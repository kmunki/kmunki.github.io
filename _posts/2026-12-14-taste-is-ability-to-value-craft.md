Silicon Valley has rediscovered 'taste.' Maybe it was [Jony Ive at Stripe Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLb9g_8r-mE). Maybe it's Substack aesthetes like [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/how-to-have-good-taste) and [David Hoang](https://www.proofofconcept.pub/p/what-does-it-mean-to-have-taste). Maybe it's everyone trying to figure out if AI can have taste. But taste is, in every case, either ill or incorrectly defined, if at all. Let's fix that.

Taste is the valuing of craft.

That is, taste is the ability to *assess* and *appreciate* a work based on deep understanding of *techniques* and *skills* used in the work's creation, whether it's a car, a novel, an app, a song, or an outfit.

In Jasmine Sun and Robin Sloan's Utopia Debate "Can AI have taste?", [Sun argued](https://substack.com/@substack/note/c-186546503) that if the YouTube or Spotify algorithm ever gave you a good recommendation, then yes AI has taste, because it understood and recreated *your* taste.

No. Algorithms understand your *preferences*. Taste is not your preferences. Preferences are, however, the thing most commonly *conflated* with taste.

Your preferences are *intuitive* taste—a starting point. Preferences rarely ever *fully* match with taste. That is what a guilty pleasure is! You like it even though you know it's not good (*Stranger Things*), or hate it even though it is (Hemingway). Paying close attention to what you like is an excellent way of building taste. Preferences are a great signal that something *might* be good.

The opening paragraph of [Roger Ebert's review of the Mummy](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-mummy-1999) is a perfect demonstration of his exceptional taste being in seeming conflict with his preferences:

"There is within me an unslaked hunger for preposterous adventure movies. I resist the bad ones, but when a "Congo" or an "Anaconda" comes along, my heart leaps up and I cave in. "The Mummy" is a movie like that. There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased. There is a little immaturity stuck away in the crannies of even the most judicious of us, and we should treasure it."

Ebert contrasts his judgement of the craft (script, direction, acting, effects) with his visceral delight. His pleasure is, by his own admission, unreasonable; he cannot entirely *explain* or *justify* his delight. Ebert's taste, that is, his understanding of craft, is so practiced as to be intuitive and, therefore, harder to articulate. The obvious elements of craft that he would normally judge are, in *The Mummy*, just mediocre. Ebert had two options: 1) a pedantic drill down into why, precisely, *The Mummy* is actually quite good (e.g. [shots like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbq2UV3XSeU)) 2) to share, as he did, his visceral child-like delight. Delight that likely drew him into loving, and thereby understanding, the craft of movie making in the first place. Ebert, trusting his taste, chose the second door.

*The Mummy* belongs to a class of films that are "better than they have any right to be." Another is *Mad Max: Fury Road*. To enjoy it, which almost everyone does, you don't need taste. But Miller's epic *is* a master class in craft: [screen 'writing'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u6DwJOs604), [cinematography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR7ejkmf8Y4), [coloring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1laGurs-CXg), [world-building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipkOfuCklZU&), and [editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSQYvHIvjB4&t). Preferences tell you if you like something or not. Taste tells you *why*, which both allows you to appreciate it all the more and to value it even if you *don't* like it.

Taste is not merely a capability, it must be exercised.

Robin Sloan, contra Sun, argued that taste is "courageous decisions amid finite options." Sloan is wrong about finitude, but is right about courageous *decisions*. AI struggles (currently) to have taste because it has no reputation to stake on its opinions. It cannot make *courageous* decisions, nor can it rise to defend excellent craft. Taste is always *applied*.

Taste results in and is demonstrated by choosing well. This is why taste is separate not just from preference, but also criticism, style, and design.

Criticism is not taste. Critics translate their taste into essays or videos that help others judge what to spend time on. Critics pass judgement on a work, yes, but they then must *explain* themselves, articulating why work succeeds or fails on the grounds of craft. In doing so, good critics *translate* their taste, thereby teaching it. Style is not taste. It is the *result* of taste. Stylish people are able to judge the craft of wardrobe and then *execute* on that, for others and themselves. Designers, be it technology, fashion, or visuals, are similar.  Designers transform their taste into products that people use and, hopefully, enjoy. Design is how it works and feels to use, not just how it looks.

The very best applications of taste — beautiful criticism, exceptional style, meticulous design — often change public opinion, [defending and celebrating the misunderstood, the different, and the new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JPOoFkrh94&t=4s). Good taste is *virtuous.*

In being a virtue, taste comes with duty. While bad taste can be a lack of skill or experience, it is more often failure of duty. This can manifest in at least three ways: politics, populism, and snobbery.

Politics can blind one's taste. Politics hides masterpieces that disagree with it or cheers dreck that agrees. The canon is an attempt to enshrine taste, to highlight that which has stood the test of time. The best art, the highest craft, touches the universal. Politics almost never does. There are phenomenal works of art that are also highly political—*Dr. Strangelove*, *Huck Finn*, *Guernica*—but succeed on the merits of their craft *first* and the message resonates through time, even as politics and parties change.

Claiming that a work is *good* just because it is *morally right* (based on your politics) is ultimately just *preferences* in disguise. It is not a recognition of *craft*. It is against good taste to hold one's nose to praise something poorly made for its 'message'. Worse, it undermines and discredits your ability to celebrate the rare few excellent political works when they do come along. Do not abdicate your taste to politics.

Similarly, taste should not succumb to the collective preferences of populism. Rebecca Yarros' *Fourth Wing* is stupendously popular, as are the sequels. This does not make them good. They are, in fact, terrible *in terms of craft*. The characters are either cliche or goal-less plot machines, the world-building and romantic tension is entirely built on Lost-style mystery boxes, and despite that, you can see what's coming from a million miles away. On a pure reading level, however, it's fun as hell. It's not quite *The Mummy*, but it's close. Certainly on par with the *Mission Impossible* and *Avatar* franchises, which are both exceedingly stupid and also perhaps among the last remaining reasons to see movies in a real theater. It would, however, be a kind of dereliction of duty to say *Fourth Wing* is a *good book*. It's an *entertaining* book, exceptionally so. But it still must be said that it is a poorly crafted book.

"Let people enjoy things!" is the barbarian's retort. You're a snob! Stop. I can point out the failures of craft without telling you that you shouldn't like it *or* judging you if you do. This is the courage Sloan was talking about. Good taste can and often *must* contradict popular opinion.

Thus, finally, we come to snobbery. A snob is someone with good taste who has made the same mistake as an amateur: confusing taste with preference. Snobs make one of two mistakes, both of which are abdications of the duties of good taste. The first is to judges a *person* for what they like and appreciate. No. Taste judges works, not people. Further, good taste teaches. No one is born with taste and no one has good taste in all things. The snob forgets this.

The second form of snobbery is mistaking popularity as a sign of lack of craft. This is a fallacy. *Seinfeld,* The Beatles, Georgia O'Keeffe, the iPhone, and *The Lord of the Rings* are all extremely popular. To say they lack craft is treasonous to taste. We are shown, once again, the value of the canon; it serves as a bulwark of taste against the tides of mass opinion in all its forms.

"But," the savvy snob asks, "isn't ceding ground to poor taste *itself* a demonstration of a lack of taste? An abandonment of virtue, done out of a misguided attempt to spare feelings?" The snob has a point. The virtue of taste demands we neither be snobs nor pretend things are good because they are liked. What are we to do?

The answer is: be like Ebert. We all have our indefensible pleasures. Courageously celebrate that which you irrationally love. *Fourth Wing* is a badly written book that I enjoyed reading.

Taste is a form of authority, but to be virtuous, it must also be vulnerable and open. Taste is not armor, it is a syllabus. To dismiss or demean those who do not yet have good taste means you do not sufficiently value your craft. Taste is what allows both curation and the canon to be worthy of the name. It is a privilege to have taste, yes, but also a responsibility to bring it to others, not to keep them out. The best taste is almost a kind of evangelism.

As Corey Beasley points out [the virtue of taste](https://regularmag.com/2025/09/04/what-good-is-good-taste/) is that it can get us talking to one another:

"Taste, then, brings the Intellectual into conversation with the larger popular culture (surely an important world for an intellectual to understand), and taste brings the Populist into conversation with ideas and forms that would rarely, if ever, be permitted to find expression in popular culture. In either scenario, the mind expands. The nice thing, too, about art is that you don't need to like it for it to change your life."

Taste is the virtue of *valuing* craft, with both the power and the duty that entails. It is meant to be shared and explored. Develop good taste, bring others on your journey, and celebrate it wherever you find it.
