# Deep Dive: Why Editing is Hard for AI



There are lots of writers. There are lots of people who deeply understand AI who write *a lot*. What’s the hold up?

First, writing good fiction is hard, but so is coding. Defining good fiction is almost harder than writing it. Good code works. You can’t ‘verify’ writing is good. There is no formula (yet). AI is not trained to write well:

1. **Good writing is idiosyncratic**. A great code library or pattern is designed to be reused. The best lines in fiction are unique and, after that, are *quotes* or *allusions*. Even re-tellings, like *Demon Copperhead* or *The Lion King* have to change enough for the story to only be recognizable when you squint. AI, like people, default to being generic and it takes a lot of work to bring out the good and unique together.
2. **Good writing takes a lot of bad writing.** A lot of writing is about finding voice, which is about practicing, which is, in some sense, about *exhausting* the generic part of your voice. You’re almost mining to get to bedrock. You’ve got to strip off the layers of soil, clay, and silt. There is no obvious analogue with this for AI. It might not be prompt-able, it might need to be done in training.
3. **Good writing is vulnerable.** The best writing is usually some exposure of the writer. A common trope is for writers who just ‘give up’ and write what they feel in their truest self end up finally writing their masterwork. It’s not obvious how an AI can be vulnerable.

In short: AI aren’t set up to be great creative writers. It’s telling that while professors are struggling to tell a student essay from one written by AI, you’re not hearing about this as an issue in creative writing courses. 

There are a lot of headwinds:
1. **AI default to being generic. Editors are masters of specificity.** An editor has to do the miraculous work of reading a work, understanding what the author *wants* to do, seeing where they *don’t* accomplish it, and helping them do it.
2. **In-progress novels need a LOT of context.** At the 80% mark, a novel is often still 50% longer than it should be, and there are in some cases dozens of versions of a scene, as well as tens or hundreds of pages of supporting research and content (e.g. character sheets). A brief 70k word novel might have that again in additional relevant context.
3. **Writing requires taste and craft.** Craft and taste come from experience, exposure, and practice. What’s particularly difficult is taste and craft are both opinionated and universal. Someone with great taste can recognize excellent craft even if something is not to their preference.
4. **Editing is a relationship built over time.** Getting feedback is hard, and learning what kind of feedback to give and get that will be most effective is also hard. Usually the relationship allows for this ‘continuous learning’, but AI famously do not have that.

Thus, the problems:
1. Context: The AI needs the right amount of context about the right parts of the novel at the right level of detail for the task at hand.
2. Learning: The AI needs to be able to get feedback on giving feedback and on its understanding of the novel.
3. Taste: The AI needs to understand the nuance and complexity
