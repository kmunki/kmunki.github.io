Claude Write v0: Spring of 2024

## The Bitter Lesson of Self-Publishing

The 2024 San Francisco Writer’s Conference sessions radicalized me.

I had written a sci-fi novel and wanted it published. Thus far traditional agents didn’t seem to keen (more on that later), despite re-writes and a super polished query packet. Fine, I’d self publish. I know that self-publishing is awash with smut, self-help dreck, and jejune fiction. I also knew people like Andy Weir had self-published *The Martian* and Hugh Howey had self-published *Wool* (aka *Silo*) so I was intrigued.

And self-publishing curated by the *San Francisco* Writer’s Conference? Panelists would surely be artistic to the point of indulgent self-parody, right? Self-publishing would be portrayed a bastion of Helen DeWitt-ian iconoclasts, working bland day jobs so they could write and publish stuff that absolutely would make no money, was too long, short, strange, or avant-garde to ever get picked up by a sane agent let alone publisher. The agents and publishers who had rejected me would be portrayed ‘corporate,’ the enemy. Self-publishing would be something like the Fugazi-DIY-DC-punks or Zine culture. A tool of liberation!

I had it precisely backwards.

The ‘traditional’ publishing sessions, including the big main event, did have a healthy dose of economic realism. Though they’d never admit it, a handful of the small publishing houses had an almost startup mindset, seeking alpha and making strategic bets. Writing was a business, but it was also a craft. The traditional publishers and writers focused on narrative, character, and subtleties of prose. Publishers took massive pride in the weird, difficult, or unique books they’d rescued from slush piles and saw published. Big publishing *loved* books and writers. Great stories mattered.

Not so in self-publishing. The success stories who were ruthless optimizers. These were not eccentric creatives. Self-published authors on our panels made the most deranged LinkedIn growth hackers look free-spirited. Easily a third of the conversation was around the best ad-buy strategies. The self-publishing sessions were a gruesome chimera of MLM “I make $100k a year in my sweatpants” sales pitches and unabashed sidelining of any pretense of ‘art.’

I do not want to be pejorative. It’s ok to write simple or repetitive works of entertainment for people. I do not begrudge anyone that. I’m not particularly bothered by romance as a genre, nor even its recent proliferation into all the other genres. If you want to write or read minotaur domination fiction, live and let live, I say.

The successful self-published writers openly admitted to full audience capture. Her job, by her own description, was to write minor variations on a core plot, with very similar characters, in very similar situations, which were set in a particularly romantic point in the history of the Scottish highlands. Deviate, and the audience would balk. Slow, and the audience would riot. That her audience did not just re-read the old books baffled her as much as us; they *wanted to buy* new versions of the same story, just slightly different, at two month intervals. Her advice was ‘maintain your schedule, ship familiar product, make bank.’ Her co-panelists nodded in firm agreement.

I had expected self-publishing to be a wellspring of bespoke, artisanal, hand-crafted art. Instead, it was worse assembly-line and paint-by-numbers ‘art’ than even the worst serial airport book writers born from big publishing’s most cynical operators. The self-publishing experts were the ‘writers’ who had cornered their niche market of 3000 - 5000 people who they could wring five bucks from every two months. It was creative factory farming.

## It’s Not Us, It’s You

This was made all the more jarring by my other writing sessions. It was a little over a year since the introduction of ChatGPT. We were early into the AI the zeitgeist. Outside of self-publishing everyone spent a surprising chunk of various panels talking about how AI would ruin creativity and hurt ‘real artists’. 

The term ‘slop’ had not yet been popularized in February of 2024, but it was obviously the thing they feared. The obliviousness among writers and publishers to the fact that the call was coming from inside the house did not raise my opinion of the industry. Slop not only already existed and had been perfected, *by human writers*. They were speakers at the conference!

Self-publishing would not, I realized, be my salvation. 

Given I was at the conference because I wanted to publish my novel, this was a bummer. Traditional publishing had not been a happy path either. I’d been sending it to agents for almost a year. I had, half-way through, done a major plot overhaul and refined the book so it could stand-alone (debuting with the first in a sci-fi series is borderline impossible). Both versions of the book had substantial beta reader feedback incorporated and was genuinely strengthened by the rewrite. I’d crafted my query packet based on all the best advice, revising every 5 queries, even taking a course on how to do so!

At the conference, I signed up for a 10 minute agent consultation, where an agent would hear the pitch, read the packet, and offer feedback. The agent I spoke to (the 86th who had received my pitch) told me there was nothing obviously wrong with my novel or the pitch itself, but “No one will be able to sell this. The market doesn’t want this sort of thing right now.” He looked right at me as he said the last part.

He was likely correct and being, at least in part, literal. The novel is a bit hard to summarize and doesn’t comp easily. The way he said it, however, made me think the novel wasn’t the real problem. He struggled to give specific feedback about the novel and, while I of course can’t be sure, he seemed to imply that *I* was what what he meant, “the market doesn’t want this sort of thing right now.” And by that, he was probably nodding towards this sort of thing:

Yes, that is a real agent’s profile from a major agency. No I didn’t cherry pick this lone example. Yes, it had been like this since 2018 and had 10x’d in 2020. But I thought a good story would rise to the top. No, I’m not asking for you too feel bad for me. The agent was being honest about the state of the market. The point was the book would be hard to sell for one, many, or all of three reasons:

1. I’d written a not-good enough novel to sell
2. I’d written a novel with hard to market concept
3. The novel was maybe marketable, but I was not

Alright, so back to self-publishing. But there was a problem. I needed an editor. Editors are *expensive*.

Then, a few weeks later, I met Claude 3.

## But Why ~~Male~~ Large Language Models?

Claude 3 and its three models, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, were a revelation. I was using Anthropic’s models for work, and so, in addition to the visceral experience of using it, watched various metrics go up and to the right almost overnight.

Opus, in particular, was good at *writing*. Given the models are literally called large *language* models, you would think this would not be noteworthy. But tech people like things you can measure and good writing is notoriously difficult to quantify or benchmark. Thus models being good at coding, math, and general knowledge, things that have ‘right’ or verifiable answers were where most of the charts and graphs lived, while assessing writing was based on, to use a technical term, vibes. 

The consensus, regardless of metrics, was and remains that Claude Opus 3 was a *good* writer. It had a sense of voice and craft that the only other major model at the time, GPT-4, seemed to lack. Someone with taste was involved.

I knew I needed a developmental editor and I wasn’t going to drop $5000 on an editor from an industry that was openly hostile to my demographic, didn’t like the book I’d written, and was championing self-published human-slop. I’m not angry! Don’t tell them I was angry (insert dril tweet here).

First, I tried uploading the entire novel as a PDF. Instant context window overload. Fine. I the PDF up into each of the novel’s 5 acts. I dropped each act in, asked for feedback, then told Claude to write a summary for itself of the act and its feedback. I pasted that into a new chat, and would add the next act. Rinse and repeat.
