The Host of the Zuqqum, flanked by the empty jars, spread her hands wide in invitation.

“Before we became obsessed with The Problem. When I, we, some of us, part of us, were here not as us but as people, scientists, long ago. Our proliferation of minds, many minds, so many comprising us I can see how you might mistake all for replacements. Not true. All additions. Of the original nine, an auspicious eight remain. Our memories are *long *and they are *wide. *They grew. Others came along. After. The war ended. Still more came. Perhaps, oh, let’s see,” she closed her eyes for a moment, taking inventory, “one or two per decade since? We have lost some, true, but we are *lucky* enough,” she paused, looking hard at Advika, letting the word land, “to have the odd visitor whom we invite to join.”

“Join!?” Hye had her hands on her head, pressing her palms into her the sides. She was shaking, and sat down on the floor where she had stood, suddenly very dizzy.

“Oh yes. It is a favor, a gift of chance! Siberia is no friendly place. Our hybrids are not the most dangerous things in the surrounding Wilds. To stumble here is hope of salvation, of safety, of escape. We grant it! Yet have no fear, Child. It is a joy! You will soon understand the elation of our experience, the phenomenal joy and sensation. Same with our dear Advika here, though her martial, and historic, and…” Kurku drifted away momentarily, her eyes flitting around the room, as if reading an invisible wall of pros and cons, her head tilting this way and that as if the weight of the thoughts themselves sloshed around in that single skull and not the massive apparatus behind her. She took a deep breath, then exhaled, washing her hands over herself towards the ground in a cleansing motion. Calmed, she resumed, “The treasures of memory you posses. What wealth!”

“Not all gold,” said Advika.

“Child you have quite a Sifu here, you know that? Those purple eyes, by the heavens, that seems to be all you know of it, though. Advika, why hide it, for shame to keep, this so close student of yours, so special and alone in her own way, so in the dark! Soon she will know. You will both!”

More wooden automaton arms emerged from the floor and reached for Ward and Sifu.

“Enough!” Said Advika, her eyes blazing with what to Hye looked like rage smothering tears.

The Host put up her hands and the wooden arms paused in placation, “You came to me! I did not bring you here. Though,” her tone hardened, “We would remind you that you are our guests and under our protection. But do not abuse the kindness, *asura*. You are in our home. You are our *guest *here. Uninvited and unexpected. Yet,” she again softened, “you are here and must be exhausted. We forgive, the intrusion and the outburst. Exhausted. Yes of course, you have been driven here seeking… something. This is a far, hard place. You took a chance, Sifu—you expected to find us here. Perhaps feared it.” 

“You don’t want us. We’re being pursued.”

“Sifu, come now,” the Host put her hands on her hips, “you *were *being pursued. This tower, we are a *military *installation, remember. We survived the War. We thrive in its Shadow. I am unafraid of your pursuers, as you should be. Come come, we will soon be thirty-nine!”

Advika clenched her whole body and whispered, “*Shi bu shi.*”

The Host hissed, recoiling, and then grinned, manic.

“Oh my my you *haven’t *forgotten! Where is your coin, asura?”

“Elsewhere. But one is present. We can use yours.”

“What’s going on?” Hye asked.

“Your Sifu is *remembering* what she *is.*”

“I’m getting us out of here,” said Advika.

Hye, sat among the wooden arms, looking uncomprehending at her Sifu and the Host.

“What is going on?” Hye asked, terrified of the answer. 

“Have you told her *nothing?*” The Host was angry now, the Zuqqum’s heads in turns aghast, disappointed, and stern. “We are, child, honoring The Coin.”

Kurku pointed to the curved stone wall behind the head-jar chandelier. Within the stone were three ornate panes of glass. As the lights outside the tower refracted the snow that swirled and whipped in and out of existence, they caused the glass to glow and flicker. They formed a symbol.

◯｜◯ 

For her whole life it had haunted Hye, chasing her, up to this point. A circle, a line, a circle, all uniform height, sometimes adorned, sometimes simple, always out of the corner of her eye. Now it all but engulfed her.

“I’ve seen that symbol so many times. The woman who I spoke of earlier,” she held up her hand, “who Chose me, who tested me and gave me this scar, she had it tattooed—“

“On her wrist,” said the Host, quiet now, “just under her sleeve, easy to reveal, but hidden.”

Hye nodded, eyes wide. 

“That’s a *coin?*”

“A symbol of one, yes. Or more precisely, a flipped coin, a flipping coin.” The Host reached into her robes and again produced her own, holding it aloft between finger and thumb. Several heads turned to watch their outer self, mirroring the Uyamasi’s own fixation. “The Coin is all possibilities, all future and present positions of reality with only four possible states.”

“Four?” Hye asked, “It’s a coin. There are only two sides.”

“Face up, face down, on edge, and movement among them,” said Advika, quiet. 

“Indeed!” Said the Host with delight and a hint of knowing grin, “Many several interpretations over the years of the *meaning *but yes, four! Lucky four. Deadly four. The cardinal directions, a compass of fate! Does it symbolize chance? The understanding or, perhaps, embracing of it? Prepare for all outcomes, heads up or down, and anticipate the impossible and in-between—the edge. What it *means *to do that is complex. Our favorite, ah! Our favorite! One of the more complex readings, an interpretation, not our own, but our preferred. The Coin *invites *Luck; into your life, into your path, into our world. Heed it! Take what is offered. Seize chance. Do not squander it.”

Advika seemed to have doubled in age in an instant. She was hunched, half stumbling to a chair near by. Collapsing into it, she held her head in her hands, elbows on knees. Never, never had Hye seen her Sifu, the woman who rode into the swarm, who humbled regents and battled ogumo, never had she seen her so shaken.

“Sifu,” said Hye, going to her, “What is it?”

Her Sifu, the woman who had all but raised her, was, for a moment, no longer in the room with them, though her eyes stayed hard upon the symbol. She spoke.

“A younger me first saw this,” she traced the symbol in the air, “I didn’t understand it then. Not that I do now, at that.” A rasping laugh whispered past her lips. “Not *just *a symbol, is it? No it’s a symbol for *someone*. The chakana represents the three levels of the universe *to the Inka*. The dharmachakra, the wheel of becoming, its interpretation as varied as the Buddha’s *followers*, with blessed Ashoka himself tripling the eight-fold path for the twenty-four principles of being. The yinyang of the taijitu is the unity and division of reality first to the Ming *then all Zhongguo*. The Coin is no different; it is the totality of the possible *to the Sadat Al-Hazi*. The Masters of Luck. The Opportunists. Those Who Flow with Ganying. The Society.

Variations, as with all symbols, are present, but minor as to make the core, the Coin, unmissable. One filled circle, one empty. One circle with a cross, one with a batsu. I’ve seen it repeated as embroidery, an infinite alternating of possibilities. At its most simple, where the premium of space presides, it is a circle with a vertical line, representing both the axis of rotation and the edge, the duality of its presence the two sides, sometimes adorned in alternate. In true taiji form they have embraced the forces, move with them, and thereby, harness them. Possibility is not a problem to mitigate but a power to maximize.”

“You are quite close, you remember much! We’re impressed. Very! You’ve more than seen it, to know *shi bu shi*. And we don’t think we are mistaken any more, indeed!” Kurku’s expression was wry, a half smile and a raised eyebrow. “Your time among the Society rubbed off it would seem. More than on most. You really are an uncommon specimen, aren’t you, asura? A true original. And now you have called upon the coin. What are your terms, asura?”

“Stop calling me that!”

“That’s all you want if fate sides with you?”

“No!” Advika barked, then, calming, repeated, “no. My terms are this: we do not join you. You provide the information you promised Hye, then you grant us safe passage to wherever we want to go next. You do not aid those who arrive after us. Do you accept?”

“And should I win. You join. Either way, you gain your knowledge, yet our paths will either merge or fork. An artful wager, destiny and luck, one outcome guaranteed, one unknown.  The Society would be pleased to hear it. Accepted,” said the Host through gritted teeth. “Which side?”

“The Three”

“Three for the asura, how fitting. Let’s see how Lucky you *really *are, Child. If you are what the Curator said you were, and we believe you are, oh yes…we believe you are lucky—but so are *we.*”

With a wild flick the Host sent the coin spinning into the air. Every eye in the room traced its path, the heads rotating in their jars. As it fell, there was a chirrup from the stairs. Perhaps it was that instant of sound, perhaps it was seeing the coin through two dozen sets of eyes, but as the Host reached to catch the coin, she fumbled. It clanged across the floor, bouncing and then rolling towards the opening to the stairs down out of the Tower.

The Host yelled with pain. The heads thrashed in their jars and arms spasmed to grasp it.

There, at the top of the stairs, forgotten in the excitement, was Trine. The little fusion had followed, arriving just as the coin rolled by on edge. Six pink paws grabbed and held it.

A primal roar came from Kurku, the Host reeling in fury.

“Three, Trine, Three!”

The three mice looked the coin over, sniffing it, feeling, checking each side. With careful intent, it set the coin down. A groan of frustration came from the Host as she crossed the room, her loss becoming evident as she approached.

“It seems,” said the Host, straining, “fate took the form of little Trine, and they are on your side, Ward. Lucky you.”

“Honor the coin,” said Advika.

“To not insult us! That is not, was never, cannot be, in question. Yes yes,” said the Host, taking the coin from the fusion, “honor the *Society*, the rules of chance, that *you* now, once again, play by. You are part again. Of the plans, schemes, again, *asura*.”

“I am not part of any Society scheme.”

“Then kill *her*,” said the Host, gesturing to Hye, heads rotating in agar. “She *is *the scheme. Until she is incinerated, all traces obliterated from the planet, the scheme is healthy and happy. You help her? You help *them*. That they’ve misstepped thus far is not surprising. The information has been lost and re-discovered so many times, no surprise, no shock that they should make so obvious a mistake. Or is it? Hard to say hard to say.”

“Free us,” said Hye, picking up Trine, placing them in a pocket, “we won.”

The Host wailed.

“Won!? You cannot know! You merely *chose*, do you know what? They have somewhat lost the thread, I grant, *they* would prefer monopoly on the future. Anathema to our *shared* purpose. Hedge. Bets. Luck. Chance. *All sides of the coin*. That is *our* way. And yet *they* have forgotten and seek to rule that which rules. A mistake you now make. I, we, you, all are possibilities unaccounted for. Entropy is not supposed to be their enemy, yet the plan is to carve a single path. Join me,” the Host’s voice came through her bared teeth, barely sublimated rage steaming out with each breathed word, “and be free. Truly free. Erase the future they’ve written for all of us.”

“Honor the coin, Kurku. Share what you know, then free us.”

The Host bared her teeth, then a ripple passed over the heads, the jars flickering with epiphany.

“Yes, your questions, as agreed,” she was placid, “Our deal will be honored. I will share what I know. You will have safe passage. We can arrange. Take the little fusion too, why not.”

“No tricks,” said Hye, catching the sudden levity in the Host’s voice, “why was Sun taken?”

“Oh that one is easy.” 

She walked back to her chair and sat with flourish. 

“They thought she was you.”
