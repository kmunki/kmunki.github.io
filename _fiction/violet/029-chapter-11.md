Miriam, half-awake, strode through the research building, tea in one hand, a scribbled note from her bedside desk in the other. Seeing her through the glass-walls, scientists and researchers lifted their heads, hoping for eye contact, to nod or wave good morning, ready to explain their progress and ask her guidance on whatever war-relic they were reverse engineering or new efficiency they had found in some biological process. Yet she did not see them. She wove through the honeycomb, her thoughts on what lie ahead. Window-wrapped and sky lit, the labs had views of jungle and sea in almost every direction, morning sun pouring in. 

Her destination was darker, though. The research wing, like its sister buildings, were massive disks built into the mountain side. She passed into the shadow of the mountain, rock now above and below, and stopped in front of a heavy door. She badged, pressed her thumb, and then keyed the passcode with care. Even the door had been her design, a great arc of hardened metal within two others, such that, when the door was closed, there was no gap, no weakness, triple-thick at every point. After the events of the gala night, it no longer seemed excessive.

The days that spy’s death had been busy. Distractingly so—a mercy. She had awoken to a message from Li Xing the following morning of cryptic brevity. *Weave war-c. *In a way, it was a gift. A clear task, daunting and consuming, no room for rumination on the night prior. Obliterate yesterdays with tomorrows.

Within, she went to her desk and began to write. Thoughts, racing and branching and weaving in her mind, needed capturing. An observer might have noted the duration that she sat like this, quietly unloading the voluminous cogitation that had occurred between her waking and her arrival, but she did not. Time passed, as it must. Her scribblings became outlines became several sentences, a few to-dos, two chemical formulas, and a rough-sketched schematic. Reviewing what she had written, she drew in a deep breath and then concluding, she released it with relief, setting down the pen. The room’s chill turned her breath to white fumes, sucked into the laboratory scrubbers.

“Feel better then?”

Miriam jolted.

“I did,” she replied, after a beat to compose herself, “I did not notice you, Hideyo.”

“Yes, well, that is to be expected, no?”

“Here for a reason, or just to startle me?”

The Master of Assassins smiled, turning away from Miriam towards the huge machine at the center of the room. To the average eye, it was a monstrosity of tubes, wiring, actuators, servos, and pistons organized around a large flat tray, big enough for a tall person to lay down, arms and legs spread. Above the tray were mechanical arms, articulated with ball joints and dangling with tubing, each ending in an extruder.

“To admire it,” she said.

Miriam was taken aback.

“It is more magnificent than a time machine. Instead of dragging us to the past, it transports the best of then to now.”

Before her, the bioweaver. Hundreds of its predecessors sat on factory floors, crafting wombs, bones, and eyes from filaments drawn from spinnerets. But this machine had no twin, an invention inspired, imbued with her will and soul, it was as though Anansi himself was her Chi. The massive machine curved over a small tray, just enough to hold a body, like an ogre hunched in surgery over a pigmy. On the tray now grew, strand by strand, a black curve; the beginnings of a second carapace. The first was barely dried before enveloping its host.

“I’m not sure war relics themselves are the best of the past. Some of the Long War’s advancements are better forgotten.”

“You don’t believe that,” said the asura, “the evidence is standing all around us. You couldn’t ignore a discovery if you tried. That insatiable curiosity, that hunger for memory, it built this island.”

“What built this island was turning war-relic tech into tools of medicine and enhancement, not of slaughter and destruction.”

Two warning lights lit on the wall, a hiss, a peeling, and a mechanical thud as the door of the lab airlock swung open. Li Xing rolled out.

“Ah good, you’re both here. Miriam you’re a once in ten generations mind. I’m not surprised,” said Li Xing, “but I am amazed. ”

“I presume the carapace took then?”

“Marvelously,” said Hideyo, “for someone so opposed to war, you’re brilliant at it.”

“It’s nothing to do with brilliance,” said Miriam, “you know that well as me. It’s diligence. Those last sets of instructions were essential. More thorough than anything we’d seen. The annotations were priceless. Thank you, Li Xing.”

Li Xing held up her hands, “For those, you have Hideyo to thank. I’m not sure I could have been so persuasive.”

Hideyo smiled, her all-black eyes glittering, “Yes, well. Our relationship to the Zuqqum is complex. But fruitful.”

“Ah. Well then,” said Miriam, “An interesting ally, to be sure. I still struggle to believe there are any left.”

“Ogumo aren’t supposed to exist anymore either. And yet…”

“The past is not gone if it is not forgotten,” said Li Xing, then, redirecting, “how progresses the rest?”

“The second will be ready within the day. I learned much from the first. But my being here slows our other initiatives. We would need to double our staff, perhaps triple, if we want something resembling SenesCess a year from now.”

“It’ll be the next agar,” said Hideyo.

“Pray we are so lucky as they were at Rimac,” said Miriam, “Suppression is one thing, cessation is another entirely.”

“Then Uplift is well timed,” said Li Xing.

“We’re risking a furor,” said Miriam.

“You’ll have your staff,” said Li Xing, settling the matter, “And the Collapse?”

“I have a functional prototype—we nearly lost it to Brand’s malfeasance. Shall I thank Hideyo for that as well?”

Li Xing was inscrutable.

“Regardless,” Miriam continued, “We’ve proof it could work. Nearly full efficacy.”

“Nearly?”

“There were survivors. Unpleasant to survive, no doubt, but once the cascade is understood it will be instant and invisible. We’ll get there. Currently the dose must be very high and directly administered. Mass deployment will be… very very difficult. I can’t achieve three miracles at once, Li Xing.”

“Our work here is pressing,” said Hideyo, “we have news.”

Miriam turned from the printer, facing Hideyo.

“Let us clarify one thing, asura, this is *my* work. *Our* work is Violet. Your work was the recovery of what I needed to make this possible. True, I could not have done it without you, and for that I am appreciative. But I did it. I’m the only one who has touched that weaver. I built it. Before it made hearts and lungs. Because of me, you have that arm. Without me, you only have blueprints, not that,” she pointed to the growing black shell.

Hideyo lifted the hand, admiring her white left arm from shoulder to finger tips, stretching and flexing her fingers. There was a kinship with the carapace, she had to admit.

Miriam turned back to Li Xing, “What news?”

“Yes, thank you,” said Li Xing, “the point of our little visit. One of the tests has been passed. The Koryo.”

Miriam goggled.

“Precisely,” continued Li Xing, “it is unclear which one is the source.”

“We’ll need to verify.”

“And that, scientist, is *my *work,” said Hideyo.

“Miriam,” said Li Xing, “we will know in days, not weeks. I want at least two ready.”

“Li Xing these are—”

“I know, *precisely*, what they are. And you know what we’re after. We must remove as much of chance from the equation as possible. Overwhelming force does just that.”
