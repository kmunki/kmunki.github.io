Illapa burst out into the hall, nearly colliding with a woman just outside. 

“That way!” She said, pointing. The white streak careened around the hallway, leaping from cleaning cart to serving tray and brachiating across light fixtures and moulding. Illapa ran after. A small primate of some sort, must be a spy. The proxy for Violet? A lead, she thought as she skidded around a corner, finally!

No sooner as she had the thought then did she realize the hall was, as if by magic, empty. The little spy had bolted this way, she had been certain of it. No sign of the little… wait. The long corridor was empty, save a lone cleaning cart, left outside a room being serviced. For elegance, the cart was rimmed with a curtain, such that the various chemicals and implements of sanitation were obscured. Just below the curtain, almost hidden in the pattern of the carpet, was the curl of a tail.

“Damn,” said Illapa, “Lost it,” she said, striding towards the cart, “I best go alert the authorities.”

She thrust a hand beneath the curtain and pulled out a wriggling, scratching, flailing thing by the scruff. A single sharp shake stunned it and for half an instant it dangled. 

“Please!” Its hands shot up. White fluffy fur, black leathery skin exposed on face, rounded bear-cub-like ears, and on thumbed hands and feet. Its limbs and betraying tail were thin, given false bulk by fur: a sifaka, a kind of lemur. It wore a small vest and, upon rousing, its huge bronze eyes implored.

An instant later it had somehow twisted in her grip, all four limbs finding purchase on her person and attempting to draw itself into biting distance. She yanked and shook it hard again, then slammed it against the wall. It wailed and put its hands up again. Again it looked at her, but this time in terror.

Illapa jostled it again, a warning.

“Don’t shake Biby. Biby still now.”

“Who are you? Why were you spying?” Illapa asked as she began walking back to Tir’s room.

“Please!” The pathetic thing was begging.

Illapa sighed, “Biby, is it?”

Biby’s huge eyes grew wider, and she nodded.

“Biby, if you answer my questions, I won’t shake you. Understand?” What an embarrassment, she thought, striding down the corridor. Hardly better than vermin, no wonder the world’s superpowers still floundered. Delegating espionage to this doltish thing. Lackeys and minions were one thing—she had given more than a few henchmen and mercenaries a beating in her day and would again—but these animals, treated as something that could equal her? Replace her? It was offensive. Though it made sense here, Nairobi had too soft a spot for the hybrids beneath it. Was it only the Inka who understood that hybrids were here as a purpose, not as people? 

Right, well, she seemed to grasp the situation well enough, she’s curled into a ball of terror. A chattering, almost bird-like trilling was coming from the lemur now. 

“Silence will get a shaking. I’ll repeat it, who—“

“Please! No!” Biby pointed at the door to Tir’s room. 

Illapa had begun to reach for the handle, now paused to chastise the hybrid spy.

“Feeling ashamed, are we? Well you’ll need to face…” every hair on Illapa’s reaching arm raised, icy prickling washing up to her shoulder and down her spine. The door opened.

Kimia Tir had dressed, not her presentation suit but for travel. Behind her, was a woman in black. The woman from before. She had short black hair and ink-black eyes with no whites. The Violet asura and Master of Assassins, Hideyo Hirohito. Involuntarily, Illapa’s arms lowered to her sides. Something in the back of her mind screamed—run, get away, this is a threat to end all threats. In her grip the lemur trembled.

“Kimia what…” Illapa fought to keep her voice steady.

“Dr. Tir,” said the woman, to Illapa “thanks you for the pleasant diversion, agent, but urgent business has called her away.”

“No, I—“

“No?” The woman’s words lanced. Illapa flinched as though the word were the swipe of talons. The woman laughed, genuine, at the response. She walked around Tir and stepped up to Illapa. Holding up a wrist for Illapa to observe, she turned it back and forth, *nothing up my sleeve*. A single, long spine, white and translucent, as if of the thinnest bone, began to emerge as she flexed her hand back. A shimmering droplet bubbled out and then ran down its length. She held it within a hair of Illapa’s nose. Illapa found herself frozen with terror, unable to obey the desire to flee, unable to compel herself to fight.

“Impressive, for an Inka,” said the woman, “you live up to your reputation, Agent Illapa. I’d hate for you to end up like your erstwhile colleague. He, like you, thought seduction and blunt force were the methods of choice. How different your nations, how similar your tactics. I see why Condor partnered with the UKK’s hinterlands, your barbarisms are compatible. I’ve left the room unlocked, you’re welcome to clean yourself up if this lovely little chat causes you to make any more, ah, mess of things. I wish I could stay to watch you try to understand what’s happening to her,” she said, head nodding towards the ball of lemur. “Dr. Tir, come. We’re off.”

“Goodbye, Illapa,” said Tir, with a hint of sadness, “it was nice for what it was.”

Illapa watched them turn, walk away down the hall, and take the elevator. For seconds more, she wrestled with the paralyzing fear, as if any movement would trip some wire and detonate. *Move *she commanded herself, and she did, entering the room and flopping onto the bed. In one fist she still clutched the scruff of the fetal lemur.

“Talk!” She said. No movement, the lemur remained a white, inert, sphere. She gave it a single sharp shake. The creature, addled, uncurled.

“Please!” It said, hands up in surrender. The lemur’s voice was high pitched and nervous, the hybridization modifying the vocal cords just enough to allow more complex speech, “and yes. Follow Tir.”

“Why were you following her?”

“Please. No. Will be hurt. Secret for boss,” it began wriggling again, ”Please.”

“Who is your boss?”

“She is… she pay me spy, learn, follow Tir scientist. I find, follow, she leave room. I wait for clean, go in, wait. See you with. Both good to learn. All good to learn, to spy. Boss want to know who follow…”

The creature was lamenting, clearly upset to have been caught.

“You weren’t following Tir for Tir, but to see who followed her?” The same mission? What was going on.

“No! No no, please!” Said Biby, unable to read the confusion in Illapa’s voice, “don’t shake. True. Find you. But told to look for… different.”

“Different how. Like the woman in black?”

A shiver ran through Biby, her eyes widened, “in black?”

“Who took Tir.”

“A woman took Tir? Need to find!” Biby braced to leap out of Illapa’s grip then withered, hugging herself, “no no. Tir gone. You…” a little wail came from the lemur.

“What is wrong with you? Did you not see the woman? She was certainly different.”

“You see different,” Biby half flinched as she said, “woman?” 

Fear. The creature’s was blinded by it, unable to even perceive the woman in black. Her boss, whomever she was, knew something. Impossible this imp had the same mission by coincidence.

“You’re going to take me to your boss.”

“Boss far. Outer Mombasa. Float city.”

Vidya would have her head for leaving Uplift already. Outer Mombasa, too, was no tempting locale. Floating cities, even those moored to a proper civilization, were no place for interlopers. Even with her new friend as an invitation, she felt herself hesitating. For what was the ocean but one great wilds?

Oh well, maybe she would get a cool scar out of it.
