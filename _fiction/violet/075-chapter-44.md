The instant the train stopped in the Grand Palace station, a crush of attendants rushed forward, setting up ornate steps and canopies. Litter drivers arrived at the end of each carpet. As Illapa stepped out of the Condor Moray carriage, she saw her bags had already been strapped to the litter roof. While porters and drivers and attendees milled about in the light, mercenaries stood in every shadow. Not only had The Blade not lost their contract, but had somehow fooled the New Joseon into quintupling their order. Well done, Sadiya.

Within moments, Illapa was swept into her open-side litter, little more than a roof above a seat on wheels pulled by a moto. A lovely seat, she had to admit. She had barely settled before driver took off into the throng. The palace grounds were a riot of activity, the small city giving Nairobi-lower competition for crowding and chaos. The real Ambassador to the Continuum for Condor Moray had, to the extent that she could be, been rather cross with the Heads of Intelligence for robbing her of the privilege of attending the enthronement. Illapa now saw why. When the train pulled into the royal station, pulling waves of light rolled over them, as though they had entered a hyperspace wormhole. Now as she careened along, she saw every building seemed outlined in molten steel. Lasers danced over ponds and spotlights searched the clouds, with lanterns and brazers lining every path and street. 	Uplift was almost quaint in comparison. The grand halls, shrines, and residences were all so spectacular, she mourned that she had not gotten to stroll among them. That was in the brief, she recalled. The Koryo were proud of their traditions, one of which was to have guests leisurely take in the grounds, while their belongings hurried on ahead. They would arrive to a room awaiting them, as if home. It was, of course, power masked by luxury. Her things would be inspected, and she would, walking, be forced to take in the grandeur of the finest of all New Joseon palaces. The effect was somewhat lost when being whisked past in a careening litter.

“What’s the hurry?” She asked the driver.

“Aren’t you a lucky guest, Ambassador? Such excitement! Ward Hyeon has returned!”

Illapa sat forward, gripping the front edge of the litter.

“The Ward is *here*? She cam back!?”

“Yes! We thought the old woman had abducted her. But no—” the driver yanked the handle bars, whipping around a clutch of mercenaries ”—And the minute she got back, she challenged Prince Ji-woo for the throne! No one has issued a Crane-Dragon Duel challenge to earn the throne in decades!”

“You’re telling me that one of the last monarchies on the planet has a clause that determines ruler by combat?” Illapa, realizing her cover, amended her statement. “I’m still new to my post and am, ah, learning. I’m most intrigued.”

The driver was unphased. “It’s not just combat it’s more like… debate, poetry, and sparing rolled all into one. Anyway! The challenge wasn’t expected—perhaps it never is, I suppose—and well now with all the guests and the change of plans everyone is being ordered to stick to their residences. Easier to keep track of what’s going on I suppose.”

Within minutes the litter arrived outside a large, double-eved building. Two porters ran out to grab her luggage, scrabbling at the roof of the litter before it had come to a stop. At the main doors stood a man in traditional robes and a large, flat-brimmed hat, from which hung a long string of large beads. He had a thin mustache and a bit of beard clung to the end of his chin. He bowed as the porters sprinted past into the building.

“Greetings, Ambassador Illapa. We are honored that Condor Moray and the Inkan Technocracy would send one as storied as yourself.”

“Apparently I’m the least interesting person here.”

“Hardly,” he smiled, pressing his hands together. “I am the Daejeon of the Residential Pavilions. I’m delighted to welcome you to the Pavillion of Global Serenity what I believe to be among the finest of our Ambassadorial Residences here at the Grand Palace. Welcome! We had intended a formal royal banquet for all the guests this evening, but alas, we have found ourselves improvising as we amend our plans to keep everyone both comfortable and safe. Please, come in and join us for at least a palace gathering here within the residences. You’ll have the opportunity to mingle among your fellow ambassadors and enjoy the best our kitchens have to offer.”

“Safe?” Illapa asked, “the driver mentioned the challenge? I figured with all the additional mercenary muscle, that shouldn’t be an issue.

“How perceptive,” the Daejeon hesitated, somewhat irritated Illapa had noticed. “Yes, while you are quite blessed be among the guests who will witness the first duel in over sixty years, we are taking an extra precautions. All guests will be asked to stay within their residential palaces for the next few days. To be fair, we hardly would need to beg you to remain. The residences have all you might need at the height of luxury. Please, follow me.”

The Daejeon lead Illapa through the beautiful double-doors into a stunning central room. On low couches, around tables littered with drink and food, sat small groups of other guests in twos and threes.

“No one from the Continuum?”

The Daejeon made a small sound of surprise.

“A keen eye, Ambassador. Our Continuum ambassadors are in our other residence, the Residential Pavilion of Golden Friendship. Royals themselves are, of course, staying within the main palaces. But please, you’ve had a long journey. Your belongings have been attended to. Your room key, here. The rooms are on the second floor.” The Daejeon gestured to the elegant balcony that wrapped around the upper half of the vast room. Illapa imagined herself during the days of great banquets and balls, looking out over the balcony at the festivities below. From the center of the ceiling hung a massive chandelier, lit with hundreds of tiny lights that scintillated and twinkled, shimmering like crystal.

“Please,” the Daejeon gestured, “your things have been attended to, you’ve nothing but to enjoy the festivities and company of your fellow ambassadors.” He bowed, and returned through the double-doors to greet the next litter already arriving.

The Pavillion was vast. There must be fifty rooms, she estimated, though from the look of things there were probably more for staff. Waiters emerged through swinging doors with fresh trays of bites and refreshments. Ah, so the kitchen was there, so likely other staff entrances close by. Whatever this little lock down was, it wouldn’t be enough to keep her from the mission. This was no prison. Mercenaries would have their hands full with drunk dignitaries sneaking off to see their friends at the other residences. Fond memories of academy flickered through her mind. 

“Ah! An Inka!” Shouted a woman. “Or, I should say, *Condor*—they are separate aren’t they? I suspected one of you would be through here. Welcome! Come, sit, join our cosmopolitan soiree,” she waved a hookah mouthpiece in offering. “This Onzulu here, what was your name? No matter—she was saying *she *thinks it’s going to work. Isn’t that preposterous?”

“That is *not *what I said, Eshma,” quietly protested a Zulu woman in a what should have been sober jacket and trouser ensemble, but was too well cut to be anything but stunning. She wore small spectacles with octagonal rims, behind which were bright, sparkling eyes. “I think the Ward has a shot! Allegedly this Hyeon has been in the Wilds since the whole escapade. I wouldn’t want to fight someone who had survived all that.”

“See, Msizi, I see it as the opposite,” said a heavy set woman with dark skin and wide eyes, “Welcome, by the way, you’re the new Ambassador right? Cocohuay was a friend, I’m sure she is furious you’re here instead of her. Good, she could use a bit of humbling. When you see her next tell her ‘Winji, has eaten too much again’—she will understand. I am Winji, Ambassador to the Continuum for Nubia.” She wore white-yellow jalabiya edged in gold and interwoven with glitter. As she moved, she shimmered. “Sit sit,” said the star-ish woman.

“What do *you* think, Condor, of the challenge, eh?” Asked Eshma, substituting sobriquet for introductions. “Will it work? I find it ghastly and barbaric, of *course*, but the *excitement* of it all, the *drama*. Who does not like drama! Oh where are the biscuits? This drink demands a sweet accompaniment. I cannot eat another oyster. Condor what is your *opinion *please stop holding out on us. Are we about to just enjoy a weeks of build up in sumptuous isolation only for nothing to change? I would not complain! And here, enjoy.”

Illapa took the proffered hookah hose and drew deep, then allowed a milky cloud to issue forth. “I’ve no idea what we’re talking about. The Duel?”

“Yes, the Duel!“ Msizi offered Illapa a luminous grin. “I’m Msizi, Representative of the Onzulu. Nice to meet you…?”

“Illapa, Ambassador from Condor Moray. I must admit I’ve just barely had time to understand it—”

“By Allah,” said Winji, aghast with delight, looking off into the crowd. “You there, yes, you’re the teacher, right?” 

“Yes! You must! Come sit with us! Come come please please sit,” great plumes of smoke bellowed from the Eshma and streaked from the hookah pipe in her hand like a magic wand as she spoke.

They were accosting an old Indian woman in gray robes. She leaned on a tall staff as she walked, sampling from among the substantial spread of dips, curries, breads, meats, and fruits. Plate piled high, the old Indian finally ceded to Winji’s demands. As she sat, Illapa saw them, the famous violet eyes.

“You’re the Sifu,” said Illapa, struggling to suppress unbidden awe, “you’re Advika Shidao.” 

“I am,” said Advika, popping a berry into her mouth, then another. “Seems news spreads quickly among ambassadors. Though, I suppose, of course it does.”

“Sifu, if I may call you that,” said Eshma, not waiting for confirmation, “I am Eshma Miyan, Ambassador for the Rajput Alliance. Now, I know your first name, Advika. Not Punjabi, but northern, I hear the Sanskrit in it. But Shidao, that’s not any Indian name I’ve ever heard. It’s Zhongguo isn’t it? But you put it after your given name, so you’ve kept some of your Indian roots. And, we all can see you certainly look more like me than you do our hosts. What’s the story?”

“My first rearers were Veilers,” Advika shrugged, “shipped me off when I was young. Convinced having me raised in Zhongguo would bring peace.”

“Veilers! I thought that old cult died when the Long War *started*.”

“You’d be amazed,” Advika replied with an odd smile, “at what survives.”

“Where have you and the young Ward been all this time?” Illapa asked.

“Aila! Condor, kamaal hai! What are we going to do with you Inka. You cannot be that direct. Gods around us!”

“And here we were, Eshma,” said Msizi, her octagonal frames flashing along with her smile, “thinking it would be us apologizing for your directness. Impressive, Ambassador Illapa, to steal her thunder.”

Illapa shrugged cheekily.

Advika laughed and said, “It’s fine it’s fine. I’d have the same question. We were in the Taiga Wilds in Siberia. Survived there for about a week.”

There were only gasps.

A waiter, sensing the moment of silence, replaced drinks and the cinder briquette on Eshma’s hookah.

“Pardon my disbelief, Sifu,” said Wenji, “but had you told me you spent your time on the dark side of the moon with the Far Siders I would be less amazed.”

“I somehow doubt that,” said Advika.

“I believe her,” said Illapa, her tone somewhat serious. “Sifu I’ve got a sense that you’re more than any of us quite realize.”

Advika raised an eyebrow. “Oh?” Her violet eyes twinkled.

“Since we’re all being so forward,” said Msizi, “I am curious about those eyes of yours.”

Advika sighed. The attention was not unwelcome. Despite the coming dangers, she felt light, as though some cloud had moved on. She wished the girls were with her to enjoy it. At least Daewoo here to be a bit jealous of the attention.

“The Second Revolutions were a chaotic time. My work was, I suspect, far closer to Ambassador Illapa’s skill set than my current vocation. One does what one must to stay in the game.”

“But you haven’t answered the question, Sifu,” said Illapa. “Every sentence true, sure, but also could have nothing to do with those purple eyes of yours. And what of my vocation? So sure of it?”

“Now let’s keep it light,” said the Nubian, sensing tension.

“Hush Wenji!” Eshma expelled a massive plume of smoke as she said, “I am now as curious as an army of cats locked out of a room. Don’t go deflecting for the Sifu. She can fight her own battles.”

Advika eyed Illapa.

“Let us see where the night takes us, Ambassadors. I have too many stories to tell. Before I tell them I must first apologize for trapping you all here.”

Eshma guffawed.

“Trapped!” Wenji echoed the elated surprise. “The Koryo are many things, but miserly is not one of them. I’ll speak for all of us when I say we haven’t experienced such luxury in ages. Nubia is more laboratories than lounges.”

“I intend to smoke myself into a cloud,” said Eshma. “Even the saddest one-elephant towns used to have palaces so encrusted with jewels they held more wealth than cities ten times their size elsewhere. But the end of the rajas meant an end to their kingly residences. We are blessed with beautiful bureaucracy now. Elegant process, holy efficiency. But luxury no more.”

Wenji frowned. “Many palaces still stand! And Rajput architecture is unparalleled. You’re exaggerating Eshma.”

“Aesthetics are not indulgences! Even among the Continuum, only Koryo maintains this level of excess among their elite—on this we agree, Wenji. And I see no arguments from Msizi. The Onzulu has a hair too much arcology about it to ever truly let loose and the Inka have too much of winnowing on the mind. Sifu, you’re not native to these people, surely you can attest?”

The Sifu was quiet for a moment, contemplative. She ate a berry, and sipped her drink.

“Luxury is complex. Having lived among the Koryo for two decades, I’ve never experienced the indulgence as you have. Consider my position. In a few days, Ward Hyeon, my charge, fights for the throne. It’s impossible that Ji-woo is as cavalier as he lets on. While you all relax, largely unperturbed by the internecine conflict, I am *quite *aware of the subtle threats and maneuvering likely taking place both within our little residence and beyond. Koryo’s luxury is an illusion. Where you see a genteel gathering, I see a field of battle. To the outsider, of course, there is no better place to be stuck. For the insider, it is a prison of politics and power.”

The Sifu’s violet eyes lit on each of them in turn, punctuating the last words. She then brightened.

“But for tonight, I think, I am once again among the outsiders. And that”—she raised her glass—“is a truly wonderful place to be!”

Loud cheers erupted from the other ambassadors. Illapa felt herself giddy. They all clinked glasses and summoned the waiter for more. Topics turned to stories of all kinds, rumors of the Wilds on which the Sifu would not comment, roving political gossip, boisterous debates over the latest fashions, and good hearted story telling of absurdities seen as a representative of the state to strange lands. At one point, Illapa noticed Msizi’s hand on her thigh as she braced herself, laughing.

Well now, thought the agent turned ambassador, it seems difficult to imagine better company, indeed.
