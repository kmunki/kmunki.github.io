The Ward and Sifu left almost more cash than they could carry, most of it in a discreet case provided gratis by the bank, to be returned at a later date. *Of course*, Hye had lied, *one of my porters shall return it in the morning.*

At the Grand Pyongyang Hotel a few extra won, an insinuation of youthful indiscretion, and a promise of royal gratitude were enough to smooth over concerns about not recording their visit. The royals had a standing line of credit. No matter how chaotic the royal house became, an abundance of mandarins ensured the finances were managed and bills paid.

 A royal favorite, Advika knew the penthouse almost as well as the palace. Familiarity, habit, could be a risk. As the porter was delivering their luggage and setting up their suites, the Sifu caught out of the corner of her eye a fluffy sphere of orange and white wandering past the door.

“Hello, my friend,” she said to the guard cat. 

One of the many wonders of hybridization was that its imperfection allowed almost miraculous insight into the minds of the various animals subjected to it. For millennia, we humans had anthropomorphized different creatures, granting them personalities and generally, it seemed, succumbing to the pathetic fallacy, projecting our own emotions onto their expressive faces and demeanors. What a shock it was to learn that crows were, in fact, sly and playful; that elephants were in turns deliberative, joyous, stern, arch, and wise; that dogs were almost comedically loyal, affectionate, and neurotic. 

So too, with cats. Among the first hybrid cats, though aloof and wry, speech was common enough. With their proliferation, however, it wained. Walk into a room and they looked at you, conversation cut short — they spoke to one another, not to humans. Advika, moving quieter than most, had overheard the occasional discussion. When a human spoke to them, of course, hybrid cats understood. Along with the owls, the palaces employed small armys of cats. Excellent guards, they were able to do that which they enjoy most: stalk, spy, lounge, and generally put one over on a human who thought they had outsmarted them.

There was one exception to this rule of species-silence: orange.

“Arrowww!” Said the guard cat in cheerful greeting. Do, her name, was the penthouse’s dedicated guard. She tucked her head down and did a little summersault onto her side, stretching mightily, her paws tapping the Sifu’s feet, requesting pets. Hybridization had also introduced animal shamelessness into human socialization. If they wanted something, they simply asked for it.

Advika squatted and obliged, scratching the cat’s shoulders and ears. Tucking a large won bill into Do’s small vest, she said, “As always, our arrangement stands? I hear first?”

Deep rumbling purrs came from Do, who wriggled around with impatience as Advika had stopped petting. Do sat up and pushed her mouth-edge and cheek across Advika’s knee.

“Do? We’re not expecting any other guests. Just us. I hear first, yes?”

“Ya, yaaaank” said Do, through a half yawn, then with one last rub across Advika’s shins, she padded off down the hall. The porter followed, tipping her hat goodnight.
