The Ward and Sifu left almost more cash than they could carry, most of it in a discreet case provided gratis by the bank, to be returned at a later date. *Of course*, Hye had lied, *one of my porters shall return it in the morning.*

At the Grand Pyongyang Hotel a few extra won, an insinuation of youthful indiscretion, and a promise of royal gratitude were enough to smooth over concerns about not recording their visit. The royals had a standing line of credit. No matter how chaotic the royal house became, an abundance of mandarins ensured the finances were managed and bills paid.

 A royal favorite, Advika knew the penthouse almost as well as the palace. Familiarity, habit, could be a risk. As the porter was delivering their luggage and setting up their suites, the Sifu caught out of the corner of her eye a fluffy sphere of orange and white wandering past the door.

“Hello, my friend,” she said to the guard cat. 

One of the many wonders of hybridization was that its imperfection allowed almost miraculous insight into the minds of the various animals subjected to it. For millennia, we humans had anthropomorphized different creatures, granting them personalities and generally, it seemed, succumbing to the pathetic fallacy, projecting our own emotions onto their expressive faces and demeanors. What a shock it was to learn that crows were, in fact, sly and playful; that elephants were in turns deliberative, joyous, stern, arch, and wise; that dogs were almost comedically loyal, affectionate, and neurotic. 

So too, with cats. Among the first hybrid cats, though aloof and wry, speech was common enough. With their proliferation, however, it wained. Walk into a room and they looked at you, conversation cut short — they spoke to one another, not to humans. Advika, moving quieter than most, had overheard the occasional discussion. When a human spoke to them, of course, hybrid cats understood. Along with the owls, the palaces employed small armys of cats. Excellent guards, they were able to do that which they enjoy most: stalk, spy, lounge, and generally put one over on a human who thought they had outsmarted them.

There was one exception to this rule of species-silence: orange.

“Arrowww!” Said the guard cat in cheerful greeting. Do, her name, was the penthouse’s dedicated guard. She tucked her head down and did a little summersault onto her side, stretching mightily, her paws tapping the Sifu’s feet, requesting pets. Hybridization had also introduced animal shamelessness into human socialization. If they wanted something, they simply asked for it.

Advika squatted and obliged, scratching the cat’s shoulders and ears. Tucking a large won bill into Do’s small vest, she said, “As always, our arrangement stands? I hear first?”

Deep rumbling purrs came from Do, who wriggled around with impatience as Advika had stopped petting. Do sat up and pushed her mouth-edge and cheek across Advika’s knee.

“Do? We’re not expecting any other guests. Just us. I hear first, yes?”

“Ya, yaaaank” said Do, through a half yawn, then with one last rub across Advika’s shins, she padded off down the hall. The porter followed, tipping her hat goodnight.

Hye slept first, exhaustion claiming her in minutes. 

Some hours later she woke. The Sifu was seated on the edge of the bed, staring at the door. In the dark of the room, she seemed a statue, though the gentle rise and fall of long, slow breaths indicated otherwise. Half asleep herself, Hye asked if she should take watch. No, said her Sifu in her pseudo somnambulant monotone, go back to sleep. 

Permission granted, her body overrode her honor and pulled Hye back into the depths of dreamless slumber.

Early morning found its way into the city. Shopkeepers with keys in one hand, tea in another, and breakfast bun held in the mouth as they fumbled to unlock for business, found two rather worse-for-wear women waiting for them. A flashed brick of cash raised eyebrows and opened doors ahead of schedule. Shopping became Hye’s next lesson.

“Escape,” Advika explained, “is not an act of location but of information. You, Yi Hyeon Bong-cha can be tracked. For no one to know where you are, we can attempt to obfuscate the *where *or the *you*. The former inevitably fails without the latter.”

As Sun’s sister, shopping sprees were not alien to Hye. Fluent in fashion, Sun loved to see how a different cut could make them more beautiful, more authoritative, more rebellious. Hye had followed her sister, her translator and ambassador, through that foreign world. And now she was gone.

No, not gone. Taken. 

Survive, Hye told herself, and save her.

Among the purchases were: business suits on the nicer end of middle range; several rings and necklaces—some low value but flashy, others of extreme cost and subdued design; a fanny pack; a second briefcase and a roller suitcase; energy bars; small bottles of high-end liquor, candies, and smokes; and bullets for the guard’s gun the Sifu still had. The moto they sold, then took a litter to the train station, their newly bought luggage strapped to its roof.

“Stay with the bags, I need to get our tickets,” said Advika, handing the driver payment and then attempted to smooth out the stiff new fabric of her suit.

“No wait,” said Hye, “I will.” She strode past her teacher.

Advika half protested before catching herself, watching her student walk away towards the ticketing booth. Hye’s body language was stiff, awkward, the combination of balled up frustration, nervous energy, and *I’ll show you* pride. Approaching the booth, however, her shoulders squared, her gate smoothed, and, even from behind, she gave off a subtle haughtiness. Just like every other business traveler milling about the station. 

I might make a shade out of her yet, thought Advika.

In that thought pride and sorrow commingled; relief and agony. The world did not need more spies, more shades. What parent does not mourn the day that their child shows they know just how terrible the world can be and yet, in that same instance, feel becalmed. Your lifetime of fears and failures have been distilled and translated. Innocence traded for safety. The hope of knowing they are ready for the dark parts of the world. The pain of knowing how little you could do to brighten it instead.

Hye returned, two month-passes in hand. It was not as they had discussed—eGoli was the destination, they would take the long way through Siberia, then cut across the Sinai and follow the eastern edge of Africa to its cape. The route was be necessarily circuitous for safety. Yet they had a route. But, Advika realized, the passes allowed a degree of flexibility, should complexities arise. Not as discussed, but a good instinct. 

Hye watched the protest on her Sifu’s face fade into a wry smile of pride.
