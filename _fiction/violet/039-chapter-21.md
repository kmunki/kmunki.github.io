Three days after the palace attack that had sent shockwaves through Korea, the crowd in Nairobi's Tanganyika Auditorium had gone silent. All that could be heard were the sounds of expectant people: a chair creaked, a stifled cough, whispered words, the live-venue equivalent of vinyl record pops and hisses—the held breath before history pivots. 

Music rose. The lights on the stage increased and Li Xing rolled out to the roars of the audience; the sound was intoxicating, vivifying. 

Out of the corner of her eye she could see herself, a story and a half tall on the enormous screen. The outfit, the chair, her hair, her makeup—all intentionally designed to look smashing, effortless, and a bit avant-garde. As if even she wasn't aware of just how ahead of everyone else she was. As if it all was by accident. She just did her best, didn't worry too much about appearances, but her taste was so unbelievably refined and her mindset so impossibly forward that of course she couldn't help but be fashion forward.

She wore a cape-shoulder jacket over a suit that impressed at any distance, becoming more astonishing the closer one got. Her wheelchair seat was almost invisible. Grown to fit her precisely, it was a bio-plastic skeleton woven through with semi-stretchy filaments. At her ankles and hips, small nodules curved out, holding her slightly. As she rolled onto the stage, the chair, in one smooth motion, first reclined, stretching her feet out in front of her and her torso back, elongating her entire body before the entire unit rotated forward, putting her in a standing position. She appeared to hover across the stage, like some divine force here for salvation or reckoning.

"Hello Uplift," she said, her voice booming over the speakers. More cheers. Upbeat, poppy accompanying music began playing. "Violet is the largest corporation on the planet and today we celebrate our one month anniversary as the first *fully independent,*" the emphasis was unmistakable as she paused for effect, "Sovereignty. Greetings from the nation of Violet!"

From her position near the back of the auditorium, Agent Illapa felt her blood chill. A sovereignty. After losing Dr. Tir to Hideyo just seventy-two hours ago, after Brand's execution she'd only learned about through back channels—and now this. The conspiracy wasn't hiding anymore. It was declaring itself.

A video began to play. Sweeping helicopter shot starting over the water, rising over the jungle to reveal the huge concrete discs embedded in the side of the mountain. B-roll of scientists at work, of their beautiful jungle-adjacent dwellings, children learning in sun drenched classrooms, and ending with a clinician holding a sick patient’s hand, both smiling. A voice over begins.

The video was slick propaganda—Violet's achievements in synthetic blood, artificial wombs, cancer treatment. Statistics designed to overwhelm: eight-hundred billion in revenue, fifteen percent of global births, billions of years of life extended. But Illapa had seen the other statistics—thirteen prominent figures missing after "diplomatic visits," Brand's body never recovered, the pattern of accidents around Violet's competitors. The video ended with Miriam Okafor's face, beatific, as the narrator intoned: "It would be difficult to name a person who has done more to better humanity."

Illapa knew several who had tried. They were all dead now.

Miriam, in one of her signature bright dresses, walked onto the stage. Only those who knew how much she hates doing this can tell at all. Like Li Xing, she thought, as she turned to clap and direct the audience's attention to Miriam as she took her position along side.

Miriam and Li Xing held hands and raised them. Li Xing knew Miriam hated such heaping of accolades, her embarrassment real, making her all the more admirable and lovable. Li Xing was proud, of course, and also knew it gave them both incredible leeway to be less-than-humble on stage.

"Hello Uplift!" Miriam said, her voice booming through the speakers, "we're so excited to share our newest revolution at Violet with you today! We think it's our biggest yet."

People went nuts. Li Xing smiled inwardly. She and Miriam had chosen the words precisely. Uplift is usually a parade of promises of what they’re working on, rarely does something new that *works *get revealed. For Violet to claim anything is their biggest yet is exceptional. We are not prone to hyperbole or overstatement, thought Li Xing, and they *know it*.

Miriam continued, “We have dozens of new ways we think we can help make the world better. If you’re excited about what we’ve done so far, just wait till you see what comes next. But we have a serious problem,” her voice somber and the music faded, “Violet can’t grow fast enough. We don’t have the people we need to build the future. We need help.”

“We know we can’t do this alone,” said Li Xing, the music again rising, “And now our challenge is not just to build the next great biome boost or genetic balm. No, we’re building a nation. A new one. A country for those who wish to help make the world a better place with their heart, mind, and soul.”

Li Xing paused to look out at the confusion in the audience, relishing it. Everyone here wants her to promise them a dream. A product that will change their life, again. But it's never the thing, it's always the idea. Once I have this in my life, then I'll be happy. I'll be content. She was bursting with delight.

"Which is why we are excited," Li Xing continued, "to announce the opening of Violet Citizenship applications. We've already pre-selected certain candidates—leaders, innovators, those whose talents could help build tomorrow. They'll receive personal invitations to visit our facilities, to see firsthand what citizenship could mean."

Gasps, whoops, shrieks, and claps ripple through the audience.

Illapa's mind raced. Pre-selected candidates. Personal invitations. Brand had died trying to steal something he'd called "the List." Now she understood—it wasn't a kill list. It was a recruitment list. Or was it both?

“We’re looking to build a nation of the best and brightest. Unlike nations of the past, either founded by accidents of history or on principles of governance or justice, Violet wishes to do more than merely *exist*. Citizenship with Violet is not merely a job, it is a calling. We believe that at Violet, we should earn *your* citizenship. 

Our rights are different from other nations. You have a right to live without fear of illness or injury, and as a citizen you’ll have access to all of our care tech, for free. As a citizen you’ll never have to worry about the person across the street with more money or more power. We all receive the same salary and even that is a mere formality. We use currency as a way to regulate and distribute food, clothing, and resources, as well as to make travel and vacations outside of Violet easy and rewarding. We pay quite well, but within our borders you’ll find you have little to spend it on, as so much is already provided. What we’re building is meaningful. Life at Violet has purpose of the highest calling. Our mission is, simply put, to make life longer, better, and brighter for every human.”

“Best of all,” Miriam added, “you’ll be first to get our newest innovations, including the work I’m currently most excited about, senescence sensation and reversal. Yes, you heard right, we’re working on not just slowing aging, but eliminating it. The old could be young again. But we’re not there yet. We have a long way to go and we’ll need your help. Join us, at Violet.”

The crowd is silent. Mystified. Miriam and Li Xing bow and walk off stage together.

Turning behind the curtain and returning to the green room, Li Xing paused and waited, listening. For an instant longer, the audience remained quiet, stunned; then murmurs turned to chatter turned to exclamations and frantic activity. There was nothing like it, no sound in the world like the sound of history's trajectory being changed.

In the auditorium, Illapa remained seated as delegates rushed for exits, pulling out phones, shouting for assistants. She knew what came next—the scramble for advantage, the desperate negotiations, the disappeared diplomats. Violet had just declared war on the old world. Most of these people thought they were witnessing progress.

They were witnessing an invasion.
