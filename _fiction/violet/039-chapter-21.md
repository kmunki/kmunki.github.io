The crowd in Tanganyinka Auditorium had gone silent. All that could be heard were the sounds of expectant people: a chair creaked, a stifled cough, whispered words, the live-venue equivalent of vinyl record pops and hisses. In this world it was ah Baghdadi composer who ‘composed’ the movement of only audience sounds, so a Cage reference won’t work here. 

Music rose. The lights on the stage increased and Li Xing rolled out to the roars of the audience; the sound was intoxicating, vivifying. 

Out of the corner of her eye she could see herself, a story and a half tall on the enormous screen. The outfit, the chair, her hair, her makeup. It was all intentionally designed to look smashing, effortless, and a bit avant guard. As if even she wasn't aware of just how ahead of everyone else she was. As if it all was by accident. She just did her best, didn't worry too much about appearances, but her taste was so unbelievably refined and her mindset so impossibly forward that of course she couldn't help but be fashion forward.

She wore a cape-shoulder jacket over a suit that impressed at any distance, becoming more astonishing the closer one got. Her wheelchair seat was almost invisible. Grown to fit her precisely, it was a bio-plastic skeleton woven through with semi-stretchy filaments. At her ankles and hips, small nodules curved out, holding her slightly. As she rolled onto the stage, the chair, in one smooth motion, first reclined, stretching her feet out in front of her and her torso back, elongating her entire body before the entire unit rotated forward, putting her in a standing position. She appeared to hover across the stage, like some divine force here for salvation or reckoning.

“Hello Uplift,” she said, her voice booming over the speakers. More cheers. Upbeat, poppy accompanying music began playing. “Violet is the largest corporation on the planet and today we celebrate our one month anniversary as the first *fully independent,*” the emphasis was unmistakable as she paused for effect, ”Sovereignty. Greetings from the nation of Violet!”

A video began to play. Sweeping helicopter shot starting over the water, rising over the jungle to reveal the huge concrete discs embedded in the side of the mountain. B-roll of scientists at work, of their beautiful jungle-adjacent dwellings, children learning in sun drenched classrooms, and ending with a clinician holding a sick patient’s hand, both smiling. A voice over begins.

*From its humble beginnings in a rented warehouse, Violet has been the product of two minds. One we know well. Dr. Wen ‘Li Xing’ Xiang, a veteran of the post-war economy, Li Xing is a titan of the valley. Her companies have defined foundational technologies in hybridization, senescence prevention, and biome-regulation. None, however, have held a candle to Violet. Revolution after revolution, from artificial wombs with a failure rate of less than 0.01%, one hundred times better than the war-era incubators, to synth blood, allowing a factory to become the universal donor to billions, to onco-slow, turning all cancers into snails, too slow and too small to ever do any real harm, Li Xing has lead Violet to colossal success. Li Xing has not been alone. From the very beginning, while Li Xing was in board rooms, someone had to be in the lab, building the future. That woman was Miriam Okafor.*

Miriam, in one of her signature bright dresses, walked onto the stage. Li Xing was still amazed at the transformation she had undergone. Once an awkward wonk, she had mastered her stage craft, comfortable even when hiding her discomfort. Only those who knew how much she hates doing this can tell at all. Like me, she thought, as she turned to clap and direct the audience’s attention to Miriam as she took her position along side. The video continued.

*Okafor has proven herself a genius at resurrecting lost technologies from the war and turning them into gifts for human kind. Violet as the world leader in biotechnology in large part to her guiding hand and brilliant mind. Over eight-hundred billion in revenue last quarter alone. But profit is only part of the story. Okafor oversees Violet’s philanthropy as well. Their synthetic blood donations make up ninety percent of the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders' units. Almost a billion gallons of blood more have been cleaned of toxins and diseases with DialysisPlus. Over fifty-thousand babies per day worldwide are born from a TrueWomb. That means fifteen percent of the babies born worldwide start their journey into life with Violet. Clinical study after clinical study has shown that TrueWombs allow for full, healthy gestation, meaning a dramatic reduction in premature births and the associated issues. Being brought into the world isn’t enough, so Violet donates billions to fund schools, housing, and rearing for children around the world. Under Okafor’s guidance, Violet has saved countless lives, adding billions of years of life globally while creating countless more new ones. It would be difficult to name a person who has done more to better humanity.*

Miriam and Li Xing held hands and raised them. Li Xing knew Miriam hated such heaping of accolades, her embarrassment real, making her all the more admirable and lovable. Li Xing was proud, of course, and also knew it gave them both incredible leeway to be less-than-humble on stage.

“Hello Uplift!” Miriam said, her voice booming through the speakers, “we’re so excited to share our newest revolution at Violet with you today! We think its our biggest yet.”

People went nuts. Li Xing smiled inwardly. She and Miriam had chosen the words precisely. Uplift is usually a parade of promises of what they’re working on, rarely does something new that *works *get revealed. For Violet to claim anything is their biggest yet is exceptional. We are not prone to hyperbole or overstatement, thought Li Xing, and they *know it*.

Miriam continued, “We have dozens of new ways we think we can help make the world better. If you’re excited about what we’ve done so far, just wait till you see what comes next. But we have a serious problem,” her voice somber and the music faded, “Violet can’t grow fast enough. We don’t have the people we need to build the future. We need help.”

“We know we can’t do this alone,” said Li Xing, the music again rising, “And now our challenge is not just to build the next great biome boost or genetic balm. No, we’re building a nation. A new one. A country for those who wish to help make the world a better place with their heart, mind, and soul.”

Li Xing paused to look out at the the confusion in the audience, relishing it. Everyone here wants her to promise them a dream. A product that will change their life, again. But it’s never the thing, it’s always the idea. Once I have this in my life, then I’ll be happy. I’ll be content. She was bursting with delight.

“Which is why we are excited,” Li Xing continued, “to announce the opening of Violet Citizenship.”

Gasps, whoops, shrieks, and claps ripple through the audience.

“We’re looking to build a nation of the best and brightest. Unlike nations of the past, either founded by accidents of history or on principles of governance or justice, Violet wishes to do more than merely *exist*. Citizenship with Violet is not merely a job, it is a calling. We believe that at Violet, we should earn *your* citizenship. 

Our rights are different from other nations. You have a right to live without fear of illness or injury, and as a citizen you’ll have access to all of our care tech, for free. As a citizen you’ll never have to worry about the person across the street with more money or more power. We all receive the same salary and even that is a mere formality. We use currency as a way to regulate and distribute food, clothing, and resources, as well as to make travel and vacations outside of Violet easy and rewarding. We pay quite well, but within our borders you’ll find you have little to spend it on, as so much is already provided. What we’re building is meaningful. Life at Violet has purpose of the highest calling. Our mission is, simply put, to make life longer, better, and brighter for every human.”

“Best of all,” Miriam added, “you’ll be first to get our newest innovations, including the work I’m currently most excited about, senescence sensation and reversal. Yes, you heard right, we’re working on not just slowing aging, but eliminating it. The old could be young again. But we’re not there yet. We have a long way to go and we’ll need your help. Join us, at Violet.”

The crowd is silent. Mystified. Miriam and Li Xing bow and walk off stage together.

Turning behind the curtain and returning to the green room, Li Xing paused and waited, listening. For an instant longer, the audience remained quiet, stunned; then murmurs turned to chatter turned to exclamations and frantic activity. There was nothing like it, no sound in the world like the sound of history’s trajectory being changed.
