# Act 2: Stochastic Kaihō

“Whether or not the shared tradition of thinking, talking, civilized animals that proliferate among the myths and tales of all peoples foreshadowed hybridization is one of those debates where the emotions are substantially stronger than the evidence. I, however, shall not be wading into those muddy, rushing waters today. Should one of you encounter me at the University Social Lounge and I am plied with sufficient smoke, drink, and food, with luck you might learn my stance.

Today we instead will be investigating a more pressing question of the more dramatic *uplift*, namely, What does it mean to come into consciousness as a weapon? The first hybrids, we know, were attempts to create warriors out of the natives of the sea, then the land. If they were the soldiers and spies, then the uplifted were the generals and assassins: rare geniuses, exceptional and, due to the complex manner of creation, sui generis. Few questions haunt me more than, What would our lives be like had our first interspecies interactions been under anything but a banner of war?”

—— Scholar Aliya Ghazali, History 101, University of Nalanda
