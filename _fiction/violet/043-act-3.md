# Act 3: Ecotone Arcana

“How wrong we were about the Wilds. Empty wastelands, pah! Like libraries they held our history, our greatest accomplishments, the apex of our science. This, not decay or devolution, was the source of their supreme danger.”

—— Said off the record after a reading of *The Long War and Its Shadow by *Scholar Aliya Ghazali, University of Nalanda

“In understanding the Shadow of the Long War, remember that war-relics were not some moldy sarcophagus, shards of pottery, or a midden of bones. Would that we had been so lucky. 

The extreme gains in technical and scientific knowledge over the course of the Long War, surpassed only by its loss in those final years, meant that war-relics were, are, far more *advanced* than much of the technology present in the hundred years that followed. Every discovery was like finding Arjuna’s Gandiva, Thor’s Mjolnir, Ninurta’s Sharur, Monkey’s Ruyi Bang—weapons of the gods. Like Muramasa blades, one unlucky enough to find and attempt to wear ogumo armor or wield a vajra cannon most often died in the attempt. Worse, many relics were themselves alive. Dangerously so. Swarms, asura, aswags, busaw, aigamuxa, uplifts; those that survived took on folkloric or mythic status—their names borrowed from monsters of legend. 

War-relics were more often doom than boon.”

—— *The Long War and Its Shadow, *Scholar Aliya Ghazali, University of Nalanda
