The moto raced through the bitter downpour. Nightfall brought cold. Harsh half-frozen rain slashed and soaked the Sifu and Ward. Alone, each precipitated sliver of almost-ice was cruel, but en masse became a harsh ally—a welcome shroud against pursuit. By the time the ogumo-soldier limped back to whomever owed allegiance and delivered its monstrous report, there would be little beyond the wreckage of the litter to find; by dawn, no trace of their escape. Tracks and tells would be washed away in the night-doubling deluge. Chase was all but impossible. Escape, too, was nearly so; their own moto's headlight strained to reach the road, the beam half reflected back by the wall of lancing droplets. Hands burning with cold, Hye clung to her Sifu; both were bloodied, fighting tremors of cold and fatigue.The vertiginous forest-flanked road wound down and out of the mountains. Progress was marked by the metronome moto, tilting and wending through void. 	After some hours, the night gave way first to the lights of small towns and then the steady glow of Pyongyang. It was not a scintillating city. No flickering and blinking drew them in, nor were there bright skyscrapers found in other cities that bridged the celestial and the terrestrial with their vertical constellations. Pyongyang wore its official austerity like robes. Post-war, save the Central Palace itself and a few half-obliterated neighborhoods, the city was craters and rubble. From the shattered ruins, Pyongyang rose again, a practical phoenix. Radiant, despite the rain, a stubborn ember in the storm.

The grid-straight streets were quiet. The storm had mellowed. Little else was heard beyond the sound of rain falling through the thick trees bordering each block onto the sidewalks below. 

A few straggler officials, some harried in an attempt to stay dry, some resigned and soaked, were mid-journey home. Most shops, too, were dark; signs dimmed, front gates drawn. Hye felt as though she were at amid the ocean’s midnight depths. Like their cousin ctenophoria, a few shopkeepers thrived in this abandoned darkness. Advika had slowed, not wishing to attract attention when passing even these last resort storefronts. Within Hye could see the shopkeeps; the orange dim of their stores each a perfect square against the pervading black. This one tidied, that one read. Another seemed lost in thought, her hands holding some item that required her attention but could not maintain it. She stared into the middle distance, an old memory or impending worry stealing her from the present. 

A jealous melancholy crept into Hye as another shudder of cold rippled up her spine, shaking off the numbness. Her back was a single knot of pain, held in tension from fear and freezing. These shopkeepers seemed, if not cozy, at least comfortable. Unaware of the storm, of the dark, of their corporeal form. Trivialities of existence held their attention. For them, the world was no different than yesterday.

The moto slowed to a halt in front of a bank branch, a few lights on inside for the clerks working late. The Royal Joseon Bank of Koryo prided itself in its near interminable presence. Flanking the entrance were two stone lions. Slick dark with rain, each held a paw raised. Around their necks a collar of coins. Within, one of the late nighter’s saw the moto pull up and, with a punctiliousness that comes from being entrusted with the management of wealth for the nation’s rulers, stood and, somewhat frantically, realized he needed to unlock the door.

Still seated, without turning, the Sifu spoke in a low, sad voice.

“We’re no longer safe. Not in Pyongyang, not in Koryo. Perhaps not anywhere. I can, with luck, keep us safe. Keep you safe. For a while.”

Hye was silent for a moment. Lingering rain whispered through leaves and onto the pavement. 

“How?” She asked, “Sun is gone. Those… we couldn’t stop them…” her voice trailed off in a small coughing sob. She stifled it with a shuttering sigh. “We need help. We should go to General Jee. We should go to Bolormaa.”

Advika allowed herself a small smile. Pain had not so totally eroded her student’s training.

“Jee could help, perhaps, I would like to think so. Bolormaa, the Olgoi, an inspired choice. I had not considered it myself.”

“We earned her loyalty.”

“We earned her thanks, true, but loyalty from those conquered often costs much more. We do not know who to trust. The attack was well informed. Who, how, why—all remains a mystery. A misjudgment now might be fatal.”

 “Ji-woo.” Hye could not help but guess, to seek someone to blame, and therefore someone to hate. The world was not cruel, people were.

“With ogumo? Unlikely. Regardless, we are compromised. We can only trust those who were attacked. If Ji-woo is involved, not even that.”

“You can’t know that,” whispered Hye in weak protest. “That means there is no one to trust. Everyone else,” her voice hitched, “Sun. Daewoo. In-Yeong. They’re gone, it’s just us.”

“Us,” said Advika, turning, “includes Sun. They took her. Which means she is alive. Counting on someone, on us, to help her. Jee would be a fool to do anything other than expend every resource to keep you safe, locked away, unable to search for your sister.”

The street stretched into the dark of the rain and night. Shadows and shapes transformed into soldiers and monsters. Not empty, the streets had a few caught in the rain, umbrellas raised, attempting to maintain dignity walking through the downpour. Hye found herself looking closer, not wincing away. Was this one Sun? This one? She knew the answer would be no, yet she looked all the same.

“No,” Hye admitted, “No, I need to find Sun.”

Advika closed her eyes and let out a long, slow breath.

 “Those rumors you and your sister heard,” she said, “those questions about my past you’ve always wanted to ask me; some of them are true. Your generation mother knew me from that time. She had done me a kindness, saved my life, in a way. I owed her a debt. She could have asked me anything. There are few for whom life in the Shadow was as natural, as fitting, as me. For some reason—maybe the Yi Ching—she asked me to rear your sister and you. To teach you to survive this world.” The old Sifu put her hand on Hye’s.“No formal test I could have provided, no kumite or ritual, would have pushed you one tenth as hard and as far as the Olgoi, as tonight. Were the world as it should be there would be a ceremony and celebration. But, as that cannot be, I can only offer these words. Congratulations, Ward Yi Hyeon Bong-cha, the first half of your training is over.”

The Sifu’s words had a rare warble of emotion, pride and despair struggling for voice. Hye blinked, wiping away commingled tears and rain from her face. The Sifu looked Hye in the eyes, “the second half starts now. You have survived in the light, the world of law and civilization, of justice and honor. Now you must learn to survive in the Shadow.”

Her student’s gaze widened, surprised, then narrowed in resolve. She nodded.

“Thank you, Sifu” Hye said. Closing her eyes, she nodded with increasing vigor, stilled, and opened them again. “I am honored to be your student. What’s my next lesson?”

“We’re going to go into that bank,” the Sifu pointed up the stairs, “and take out a royal sum. We’re going to rescue your sister, have no doubt. To do that, we must first survive.”
