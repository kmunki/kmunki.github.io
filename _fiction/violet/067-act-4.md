# Act 4: Revenants' Maya

“We mourn the loss of history. Treasures of knowledge, of art, of life all lost to weathering time. So we seek to find what we can, to relearn and rediscover, and hold precious that which we do.

And yet we would be wise to beware. Not all that is lost is done so by accident. Unearthing the buried, resurrecting the dead, these are fraught. In your search for heroes, you will find monsters .”

—— *The Long War and Its Shadow, *Scholar Aliya Ghazali, University of Nalanda

“Now weapons, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them.” 

 —— Laozi
