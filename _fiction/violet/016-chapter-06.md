Brand felt the muted thrum of the party fade as he padded down an open-air corridor, his path lit by moon and stars. The corridor was covered by angled slats of wood to shunt off the daily rains while still letting in sun and breeze. Near-invisible screens stretched across the tops kept smaller, more annoying denizens of the island out. On either side of the bridge-corridor were office spaces suspended among the tree tops. The hall-bridge’s tight woven mat floor quieted his steps. He unfolded a small black flap inside his tuxedo jacket to cover the white shirt and tie, suddenly rendering him a well-dressed shadow.

Every organization has a place where the what is done and then the places where the how and why is done. Protests do their what in the streets and their why and how in co-conspirator’s apartments and in bars. Militaries do their what on the battle field, the how in great factories, and the why in smoke-filled rooms. Brand saw a few pathways branch off the hall-bridge, some towards stairs and elevators to the main disc of the huge facility: the way to what-land. Which meant the most important, the how and why, was the other direction—towards the huge, glass wrapped concrete disc of the main building. 

The muffled sounds of the party and the hum of the jungle disappeared as the door closed. Light from the night sky poured through the office windows, creating dramatic shadows from the empty chairs and desks. Brand noticed a wear pattern on the floor—ah, yes, from Li Xing’s chair—best follow those. The hall itself was simple in its decoration, but not quite reserved. Embellishments and fascinations traced the moulding and were etched into doors. Brand was saddened he couldn’t enjoy the finery, there was so little of it these days. Though the corridor continued on, the treads in the carpet finished at a great set of volcanic stone doors. 

There was no where to badge. With a lock-pick’s touch, Brand pressed the door, then pulled, checking for swing and give. From inside his collar he pulled out two thin pieces of metal, curved just so, and inserted them into the lock. 

Down the corridor, a light came on, and voices. 

Brand focused, feeling the pins twist and shift, clicking—blast! One slipped. Start again. Another dim light came on. They were less than a minute away, soon to round the bend. Gentle now. The mechanisms and gears were as visible through the tiny metal tools, and he could see just *there. Click!* Brand pushed the heavy door open, slid through the narrow gap, and oh-so-carefully pressed it closed. The shadows of the guards move across the light spilling under the door. They paused for a moment, but shortly moved on. His absence from the party or, more likely, the waiter’s, would soon enough be discovered. Time was short.

On the office desks, papers and notes were visible in tidy stacks. The labels on data reels and cassettes told him little—True Womb, SynthBlood—all existing Violet products, all mundane. On the far side of the room was a single thin slab of finished concrete cut into an odd polygon shape. On it sat the lone computer terminal in the room, offline and quiet. Who else’s could it be?

Two thin drawers clung to the bottom of the desk, tapering to blend into the shape from below. Again locked; again picked and opened. The drawer was lined with velvet and a single diskette, white with a polished metal sleeve, was nestled like a jewel. It was labeled with—what was that script?—elegant calligraphy nonetheless, and something like an infinity symbol. Let the professionals back home figure that out. He turned the crown on his watch, rotated the face *just so*, and a small pinhole lens was revealed. *Click*. The quartermaster had mentioned a photo, maybe two, could hitch a ride on the mesh, the rest had to come back the old fashioned way on microfiche. Into his jacket pocket it went. In the other drawer, a single sheet of thick, luxurious paper. It was covered in same calligraphy, though this time quite scrutable. A list of names, more than twenty, with several circled and a few crossed off. Some were famous in minor ways, a scientist here, diplomat there: merchants and corporate types; several artists. Most were obscure. At the top, the symbol again: two circles, side by side separated by a line. He snapped a photo of the list then pocketed it.

He had to get these back to HQ. The boats weren’t set to leave until later the next day. His disappearance must have been noticed, he couldn’t risk just returning to the party without cover. A distraction, perhaps? Enough chaos to end the party, send everyone back to the boats. One final trick from Q-branch. He took the pen out of his jacket pocket and turned it *just so* and clicked it once. A tiny yellow light on the clip illuminated. From his shoe heels he popped out two sets of wired bundles. After a moment of assembly, he had a small electric-bomb designed to incapacitate any power grid roughly the size of a city block. Brand had only half-listened while the old quartermaster had explained how it worked, something about a feedback loop. Another slight twist of the pen and the light changed to green, green, then two long red pulses, then stable red—two minutes to detonation. He set the device into a power socket.

Back out through the stone doors, down the dark inner office hallway. He moved swiftly and quietly onto the jungle bridge-hallway. The sounds of the island: buzzing bugs, crashing waves, the distant party, wind through the thick leaves – all were his friends, muffling his sounds has he made his way back towards the reception hall.

A door on the far side of the bridge opened—two guards on patrol. Brand froze, then with a quick thought, tore a slash in the side screen of the hall-bridge and lowered himself so that he dangled bodily among the trees, just his fingers gripping the edge. 

It was a gamble. He was still visible. Don’t look down, he willed.

They got closer. He would have to drop. Where was the overload? He looked down. The foliage was thick. No way to see the ground below, but he knew it was at least a couple stories. The guards walked right to where he was and turned. They would see him. Brand steeled himself and, as he was about to let go, the lights dimmed. The music stopped and the growing murmur of confusion could be heard. The guards looked back towards the party.

Brand pulled himself up as the power surged, brightening every light into a small blinding sun before going out completely, and in some cases, explosively. Wincing, a guard looked away and down, stunned to lock eyes with a rising Brand. Brand grabbed a foot and yanked with his full weight. The guard’s feet came out from under him and slid out half out the hole. He scrabbled for purchase as Brand himself used the guard as a climbing rope onto the walkway.

Less quick to react, the second guard was still getting his vision back when he felt a foot slam into the back of his knee. Brand took his gun and struck the back of his head. The first guard was still half off the bridge, kicking his legs trying to get traction or leverage. Brand helped expedite what gravity was attempting with a heel to the forehead, the man’s yell fading as he crashed through the tree tops and vines. Brand turned, crouched and gun ready—no one else on the footbridge. He hurried back toward the party. The emergency lights, dimmer but good enough, had come back on.

He slipped the gun into his waistband and undid the flap on his jacket, once again appearing as the party guest in a classic tux. With calm purpose and a feigned look of confusion befitting an elite guest who had just gone through this whole ordeal, Brand made his back the way he had come. As needed, he ducked into an office or closet as a set of guards hurried by. In a few more halls, doors, and turns he was once again the party. Guests, confused and concerned, were ushered about. Dignitaries without their normal retinue were terrified while socialites and heirs were bored and embarrassed for Violet—a power outage on your first day of independence, how inauspicious. Brand flowed with the crowd being corralled towards the boats. Onboard, he made his way to his stateroom.

The night had cooled, the salty breeze and gentle rasping of the waves outside came in through the half-opened door of his patio. Just lovely, he thought.

Wait, had he left that open? 

A shadow moved across his vision. His hand went to the gun, but he felt a blade on the back of his neck and froze. A pair of lips and breath just behind his ear.

“I’ll take that, thank you Mr. Brand,” he could hear her smile as she said it. 

“Who—“

The question was cut short as pain lanced across his temple and he collapsed into darkness.
