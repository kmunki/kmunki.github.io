The Viceroy’s summons was as sudden as the storm. Leaden rain pummeled the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Viceroy’s retiring room. Acid-white freeze frames of the lawn, gardens, and forests of the palace grounds, blurred and distorted by the inundation, flashed with each lightning strike. Hye and Sun sat on a circular couch sunken into the floor. A suspended hearth floated at its center; the retiring room’s only sustained light the flickering orange of the fire.

Advika stood at the huge window, watching the rain stream off the statues and overflow the fountains, the sopping branches of trees bending under the tug of gravity. Hye could only see her silhouette, a shadow cut out of each white strobe. The Sifu was bowed, leaning hard on her staff. 

 The door to the room slid open and the Viceroy and Vizier entered the room, proceeded and followed by guards, accompanied by one of her consorts. All stood.

“Your Excellence,” said Sun, standing and bowing.

She waved them silent.

“Sit.”

“I announced my abdication earlier today. The timing is inopportune but it can no longer be avoided. The Selection has begun.” The Viceroy paused, debating within herself on how to proceed, “Seong-ma, you are young. Too young for all of this. And yet, for the Olgoi, for the agar, I grant you a boon.”

In the dozens of fantasies she had of this moment, Hye imagined her sister and her smiling, screaming, enraptured with joy. But the Viceroy’s tone was not one of pride or celebration. It was as though she had not blessed, but cursed them.

“Thank you, your Grace,” said Sun, bowing with baffled humility.

“You are confused,” said the Viceroy, “but your Sifu is not.”

Vizier Daewoo whipped around to look at Advika, then back to the Viceroy. 

“What are you implying, your Grace?”

“Look at what has occurred,” said Advika, turning from the rain pummeled window, “A sabotaged transport to the Olgoi. Not even a cut axel or flat tire at the port. Weakened just enough to break mid-journey. Intentional. Someone expected to not just delay the shipment, but to kill the crew. Not even that though, the crew was just incidental. A rounding error in the cost of global politics.”

“The Zhongguo, right?” Said Sun, “who else? They have the most to gain from our failures.”

“We had thought so,” said Daewoo, “until Hudo.” She trailed off, massaging her hands.

Advika stiffened. “Hudo wasn’t meant to be found. Perhaps they are not connected. Two unrelated tactics from two different enemies. Possible. Plausible, even. But now we have a third issue, don’t we? A threat from within?

Viceroy In-yeong nodded. “Yes. A threat to the Selection and the Viceregency itself. Prince Ji-woo.”

“Ji-woo!?” Hye spluttered, disbelieving.

“His announcement was hardly an hour after the Viceroy’s,” said the Vizier. “Yet he was unlike himself, as if…”

“Possessed,” finished the Viceroy, “his speech was eloquent, moving, and potent. Gone was the clown.”

Sun and Hye looked to each other, desperately seeking understanding in the other’s eyes.

“It’s a fair question,” said the Sifu, as if mind-reading, “how do these three things relate? How could the Olgoi, Hudo, and Ji-woo be related? Think. For a moment, *be the enemy*.”

Hye’s mind began to reflexively empty at the utterance of the well worn prompt from her tutor. 

“Feel as they would, think with their rage, their loathing, their cunning, their pride. Let the timing be more than chance, find purpose in it. What do you discover?”

Hye had closed her eyes, her selves shifting as her own desires and demons were set aside, leaving space for the wants and worries of all who might threaten Koryo. A favorite exercise of Advika’s, it was a meditation of sorts, *hypothetical cogitation* she called it. Years of study—the literature, the history, the propaganda, entertainment, fads, politics, fashion, celebrities, and religion of nations—blossomed into personas. Hye let herself become those who most wanted to harm her. She saw her nation’s own treachery, the violence of the Joseon, the madness of the Koryo’s breeding and rearing, and *there*. The fury arrived. She needed to destroy *them*, but how. When would the Koryo and their infernal collective, the Continuum, be weak? When was any nation weakest?

“The Selection,” said Hye and she heard Sun say it, with her, almost in unison.

Daewoo goggled, looking from the siblings to the Sifu and back.

“Good,” said Advika, “my thought as well.”

“The Zhongguo are obvious. Clear motive, means,” said Hye, “thus easy to frame.”

“Which leaves us distracted,” added Sun, “exposed. For a subtler attack.”

“A more immediate, intimate one.”

“Crippling Hudo creates a gap.”

“Or would have, had we not found her.”

“Or, she found something first. Someone.”

“But why? What is the gambit?” Sun put her fingertips to her forehead, attempting to massage the insight into existence. Hye too, was stumped. Chief Magistrate didn’t pass to Koryo for another year and a half, so there was time…

“Confusion,” said Sun, “there is no objective beyond confusion. If the Viceroy was killed now, the Selection wouldn’t have had time to coalesce."

The Vizier gasped. “Killed?”

“Emergency votes would be needed, consensus wouldn’t have time to form. We’d fragment, factions would form.”

The old Sifu nodded. 

“I believe this as well,” said Advika, “the Selection process is as much about coming to terms with change as much as it is directing and deciding it. Falsely expediting it, combined with fear of an assassination and the grief over the loss of In-yeong would cause unforced errors and breed resentment and blame.”

“Goodness!” Said Daewoo.

“Indeed,” agreed Advika.

“But confusion is not an end,” said Sun, “it too is just means.”

“To hide,” said Hye, “confusion is camouflage. And we now have a new piece”

“Ji-woo,” said Sun.

The wind whipped sheets of rain against the window. Crash-boom of lightning overhead rattled their teeth. Shadows of the palace grounds were for an instant etched against the walls of the room. 

Among the silhouettes Advika caught a movement, a flicker within the flicker, paused an instant too late. Fingers and forehead pressed against the window, squinting into the soaked blackness, she saw it. Low slung and skittering, a glossy, liquid black anomaly in the grass.

“There is something outside,” the Sifu hissed.

A guard pressed a finger to his ear, “Nothing on the radio. An animal? One of the hybrids?”

“Get back, it’s no animal.”

The guard nearest, so lightning illuminated and frozen with fear as to seem a marble statue, had unclasped her pistol, ready to draw. In two blinks, the old Sifu strode to the guard, drew the pistol herself, turned and aimed out the window. Her eyes straining to pick out the threat she knew must be there.

“Put it away!” Another guard had drawn. Idiot.

“It’s not for you.” 

The old Asura heard her own voice doppler lower. 

Inhale.

Every neuron in her body was flooding with chemicals. Time dilated. Milliseconds stretched and yawned. The air itself thickened, and the dimensionality of the world became crisp and clear. Outside a bolt of lightning, starting as a sky-born spark, traced a lazy, meandering path through the air. Casually, it seemed to pause and debate, this way or that? Forking and forking, each bifurcation an additional, un-rushed attempt to find release, a stopping point, a connection. There, its finale found, stretched between two nodes, the crustacean bolt burned brighter and brighter to a blinding blue-white flare. In the all but frozen electric glare, the Sifu saw the flicker of movement for what it was. This would not last long, she knew. Hyper-awareness tore through calories and chemicals, each neuron pushed beyond physical limitations. Before the lightning crescendoed the thing surrendered stealth to speed. No more delay. 

The thing, like a man gone spider, skittered and leaped towards the window, moving while the rest of the world appeared frozen. A horrible recognition ran up her spine.

Each millisecond is a millennium as she pulled the trigger. Bones creak in her ears. The subtle resistance and strain of the trigger is enough to know the guard does not keep her gun in the best condition. Advika’s senses filled: the hammer woosh, the struck pin’s *ping*, then gunpowder roar and lead-on-steel grind of barrel grooves carving the accelerating bullet. Slug and shell exit the weapon at the same instant, former spiraling straight ahead, the latter ejected sideways into beautiful brassy rotations.

With enough kinetic energy to punch through a boardroom of skulls and still put a dent in the armor of a gobsmacked guard at the other side, the bullet punctures glass and an invisible enervated membrane coating it. Neither smart and nor picky, it did what it must when damaged, triggering action potentials that contracted billions of cellular muscles. Each spat out arachno-weave fibre like milky silk fireworks.

This was her intent, but not her target. The bullet now sought it now.

Let us regard this threat in particular, freeze it in space, rotate around it and observe its intricacies. Rain drops floated in mid air, thick and globulous. The thing itself was glossy jet black, slick with rain and painted in the stark contrast of shadow and lightning. Though human, it hunted with animalistic intensity and fervor. Having just lept, it was at full stretch, almost three meters from the top of its head to its feet. Every limb had an extra segment, where the human is extended into the arthropod. Clasped in each four-fingered front claw, as dextrous as a hand and strong enough to crush one, was a submachine gun. Though it could put them down, it rarely did, for its mid-arms can do most of the necessary work, whether opening a door or loping across the field. The head was somewhere between that of a wasp and a fighter pilot. Though not strictly sentient, the innervated suit was augmented with electronics and sensors. Clumps of ganglia made information palatable for organic cortices. Thus the human inside saw with a conglomerated vision: insect and human. From above, it looked more like a black wasp missing its thorax and wings than a human in military gear.

It had a plan; to cross the lawn, leap, fire its weapons as it impacted the glass and fly through before the weave could harden. Unplanned was a round exiting the glass a full second early and rake across the side of its face, namely through the top of the left compound eye.

Exhale.

A half heartbeat since the Sifu pulled the trigger, the window has exploded white, the arachno-weave seized into an opaque webbing. Hye recoiled from roaring, furious rage of the thing beyond. Automatic weapon fire like taiko drums and smashing fists cause the window to billow and ripple like gale savaged main sail.

“We should not stay in this room” shouted Advika, as her adrenaline rush evaporated, “they knew we were in here. It is unlikely they only sent one.”
