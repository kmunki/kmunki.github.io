Silent as a grave, the safe room door slid open. Ward and Sifu crept into the darkened hallway. A rhythm had emerged in the creature’s habits, vigilance followed by a duration of quiescence. Twenty minutes, maybe fewer, to cross the palace unnoticed, get up to the second level, enter the armory, gather supplies, and return. The safe room was left open, exposed. Preparation for the actual assault and escape would need more time. If the safe room was compromised, so too were there chances of survival.

Progress through the dark corridors was tortuously slow. What light there was came from the few dim patches of moonlight through skylights or the odd half-open door. Matte streaks across the floor lead from every room towards the kitchen. How did it feel so much darker than the first night, Hye wondered for a moment before realizing that all the lights had been turned off. Whether by someone who knew what was happening or the wendigo itself, neither answer gave comfort.

At the stairwell, Advika’s hand shot up. Hye froze an instant before something came around the corner.

It gasped, the whites of its eyes visible in the darkness, and cursed in a whisper, “Serpent feathers!” The woman held a hand to her chest as if to muffle the pounding within. “So we’re not the only ones.”

“No. We’re headed to the armory. How did you survive?”

“Walk-in fridge. Whatever that is, it’s getting stronger. It’s *cooking *and *eating *those corpses.”

“Who are you?” Asked the Sifu.

“And why are you naked?” Added Hye.

“Same reason you’re in your pjs, I imagine. Illapa, Condor Moray Secret Service, undercover. Heading to my room. This is a bad place to powwow.”

“Yes. Armory”—Advika pointed above—“meet us. Five minutes. We attack next rest phase.”

Illapa nodded and made her way up the stairs. Advika and Hye followed. At the top, they parted ways.

The armory was hardly deserving the name. A shotgun and a few handguns. A half-empty crate of flash bangs. Advika set down the empty duffle they had brought and began to fill it. Finger points directed Hye. Into the bag went the firearms, two boxes of shells and cartridges as well as kerosine lamps, heavy tape, and styrofoam packing went into the bag. The lone tactical vest Advika put on. As she clipped it, Illapa appeared in the darkened doorway, framed in the glow of moonlight. 

“Is that a dress or assault gear?” Hye asked.

“Yes,” said Illapa, grinning, “got my gun back.” The chrome managed to glint even in the dim of the armory. “What’s the plan?”

“Start to kill it when it’s asleep.”

“Will that work? The Rajput thinks it’s some kind of djinn—a ghul.”

“She’s not all wrong,” said the Sifu, checking over a pistol.

“Start?” Asked Hye.

“Start to kill it when it’s asleep, then, finish after it wakes up.”

“When?”

“I need time to improvise a few advantages,” said Advika, “Two cycles?”

“It sleeps now.  So Awake, asleep again—one cycle. Awake again, asleep again, kill?”

“Yes.”

“Right, works for me. Problem, I’ve got two civilians I need go get out.”

“I’ll lure it into the main hall. Hye, your escape is as important as theirs, you help Illapa.”

“By the names of the Sapas, *you’re Ward Hyeon*!? I didn’t, in the dark—gods of course. If we make it out of this, we have a lot to talk about. This is all a lot bigger than Ji-woo.”

“Do you know about my sister?”

There was a rustling and clanking from the kitchen.

“Hye we must go,” said Advika.

“Please, Illapa.”

“Yes. Short version? Violet. We survive, find me, I’ll get you the long version. We can help each other.”

“Deal. Let’s go.”

“See you two on the second sleep.”

Illapa could not suppress her grin. Heavy and cold, her gun felt good in her hand. Arachno-weave kevlar wrapped her body. A half dozen little weapons were strapped to her body. And she had allies. Sapa be praised she might just get out of this alive.

She made her way through the empty, darkened ballroom, weaving among the empty tables and couches. Mere hours before she had been trading stories with what she now had no doubt was an asura. Maybe more than just a… maybe *the*. The thought had crossed her mind more than once. Elided phrases, tactical ambiguity, the woman left so much to interpretation. Whatever age had been present earlier had been obliterated by adrenaline and cause. Her words of warning, how she was never able to relax here, haunted Illapa.

As she approached the kitchen door, Illapa noticed a movement in the darkness. Damnit, Msizi, thought the spy, I said wait for—

A slab of light fell across her as the kitchen lights blazed to life. Framed in the doorway, whatever had been Saongwon Moon was now the unmistakeable monster of Eshma’s childhood horror stories. The body had grown hulking, one arm hung large and huge down to its knees. With the other, it barred any remaining space in the doorway.

Before it had a chance to roar, Illapa had put two rounds through it, both shredding the smaller shoulder. Ribbons of meat hung from the gaping wound. Please, by the Sapa, let them know why I was shooting.

 It smiled greedily and began sprinting towards her. 

Just slow it down, Illapa told herself, just get to safety, no fancy stuff. 

She adjusted her aim, picked one of the thing’s feet and squeezed three times. Each round found the ankle, hatcheting it to shreds that crumpled under when it stepped down. Under the mutated corpulence’s weight the foot snapped nearly off, leaving broken stump, throwing it forward off balance. 

Illapa leaped over it as it dove towards her, flailing and skidding. She landed, rolled, and came up running. 

Do not look back. You make it or you die. 

She sprinted back toward the kitchen. 

“Get ready! I’m coming!”

She leaped over a counter and dove through the fridge door, Eshma pulling it shut behind her. Msizi rammed the can of beans home into just as the ghul loped into the kitchen and, seeing their faces in the door, charged. The thick fridge door took the impact at full speed. With a crash it caved inward, deformed and dented. 

The wendigo roared, then walked back over the main room. Soon it returned, gut once again distended, black bile on its hands and down its front. From among its pile of cooked limbs, it grabbed an arm, one with a gold cuff. Sitting back against the wall, it ripped off chunks, the cuff glinting. For minutes, it did little else but masticate. Finishing the arm, it looked up. 

Spying Illapa staring at it through the now distorted window, the ghul hurled the meaty bones at the door in frustration. With a monstrous sigh, it looked down at its ruined ankle, the foot now attached by only threads of sinew. As much as was possible, it locked its gaze on the spy. With deliberate slowness it reached down, grabbed its own foot, and yanked it free of the leg. 

A *fool me once* grin stretched across its ruined face. 

It brought its severed foot to its mouth and took a smiling bite.
