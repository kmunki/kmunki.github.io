Silent as a grave, the safe room door slid open. Ward and Sifu crept into the darkened hallway. A rhythm had emerged in the creature’s habits, vigilance followed by a duration of quiescence. Twenty minutes, maybe fewer, to cross the palace unnoticed, get up to the second level, enter the armory, gather supplies, and return. The safe room was left open, exposed. Preparation for the actual assault and escape would need more time. If the safe room was compromised, so too were there chances of survival.

Progress through the dark corridors was tortuously slow. What light there was came from the few dim patches of moonlight through skylights or the odd half-open door. Matte streaks across the floor lead from every room towards the kitchen. How did it feel so much darker than the first night, Hye wondered for a moment before realizing that all the lights had been turned off. Whether by someone who knew what was happening or the wendigo itself, neither answer gave comfort.

At the stairwell, Advika’s hand shot up. Hye froze an instant before something came around the corner.

It gasped, the whites of its eyes visible in the darkness, and cursed in a whisper, “Serpent feathers!” The woman held a hand to her chest as if to muffle the pounding within. “So we’re not the only ones.”

“No. We’re headed to the armory. How did you survive?”

“Walk-in fridge. Whatever that is, it’s getting stronger. It’s *cooking *and *eating *those corpses.”

“Who are you?” Asked the Sifu.

“And why are you naked?” Added Hye.

“Same reason you’re in your pjs, I imagine. Illapa, Condor Moray Secret Service, undercover. Heading to my room. This is a bad place to powwow.”

“Yes. Armory”—Advika pointed above—“meet us. Five minutes. We attack next rest phase.”

Illapa nodded and made her way up the stairs. Advika and Hye followed. At the top, they parted ways.

The armory was hardly deserving the name. A shotgun and a few handguns. A half-empty crate of flash bangs. Advika set down the empty duffle they had brought and began to fill it. Finger points directed Hye. Into the bag went the firearms, two boxes of shells and cartridges as well as kerosine lamps, heavy tape, and styrofoam packing went into the bag. The lone tactical vest Advika put on. As she clipped it, Illapa appeared in the darkened doorway, framed in the glow of moonlight. 

“Is that a dress or assault gear?” Hye asked.

“Yes,” said Illapa, grinning, “got my gun back.” The chrome managed to glint even in the dim of the armory. “What’s the plan?”

“Start to kill it when it’s asleep.”

“Will that work? The Rajput thinks it’s some kind of djinn—a ghul.”

“She’s not all wrong,” said the Sifu, checking over a pistol.

“Start?” Asked Hye.

“Start to kill it when it’s asleep, then, finish after it wakes up.”

“When?”

“I need time to improvise a few advantages,” said Advika, “Two cycles?”

“It sleeps now.  So Awake, asleep again—one cycle. Awake again, asleep again, kill?”

“Yes.”

“Right, works for me. Problem, I’ve got two civilians I need go get out.”

“I’ll lure it into the main hall. Hye, your escape is as important as theirs, you help Illapa.”

“By the names of the Sapas, *you’re Ward Hyeon*!? I didn’t, in the dark—gods of course. If we make it out of this, we have a lot to talk about. This is all a lot bigger than Ji-woo.”

“Do you know about my sister?”

There was a rustling and clanking from the kitchen.

“Hye we must go,” said Advika.

“Please, Illapa.”

“Yes. Short version? Violet. We survive, find me, I’ll get you the long version. We can help each other.”

“Deal. Let’s go.”

“See you two on the second sleep.”
