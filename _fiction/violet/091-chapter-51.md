Late for kumite again, Hye waddled with urgency through the palace halls. Her bare-footed padding across the tile echoed, making the whole place seem cavernous. Where was everyone? In the next room, a vaulted ballroom with only a desk and chair in the center, was Vizier Daewoo. A large clock on the wall ticked loudly. On the desk was Trine, one of their mice looking at the Vizier, engaged in conversation, while the other two turned to watch Hye approach. They greeted her with little chirrups and bobbing heads.

Hye pressed one hand into the small of her back, resting the other on her swollen, taught belly.

How long, the Vizier asked.

She asked the mouse, but it was directed at Hye, she was sure of it. Why wouldn’t Daewoo look at her.

How long have you known, she asked, how long until it comes out?

Hye looked down at her own belly. It was huge now—though it felt like only days, she must have known for longer. Pregnancy takes months, she remembered. The undertaking alters the mother, permanently. There were pictures in every text, explaining how difficult act of creation was on the creator, for the created. But with artificial wombs, that was no longer a difficulty.

An odd choice, then, the Vizier pointed, for you to carry one. Why?

A swirl as the soon-to-be-born turned in her, its elbows and knees, heels and palms, pressing into her kidney, her spine, her bladder. The clock stopped.

I’m late for kumite.

You plan to fight in that condition?

That voice—Sun. The princess was in her royal finest, fit for enthronement. She sauntered across the stones of the kumite ring, the breeze rustling the trees on the mountainside behind them. It was strange that the Vizier’s desk was in the middle of the ring. Trine looked at Hye and Sun, then all three mice crawled into the Vizier’s hand. Palm up, she lifted the fusion to eye level. Studying each other they both turned to her.

You plan to fight in that condition? They repeated.

Hye turned to Sun to ask where she had been, but she had already walked off, the edges of her robes disappearing around a curve in the path to the council chambers. She felt hot, exhausted. How was she going to fight? She was late for kumite. Within her, a kick, her belly distorting here, then there, as another came. A spasm racked her. Not a contraction, but was it?

A crowd had gathered, all of the council, other royals, even the mayor from her village. The Curator was there, and the Mandarin Bok. Here to watch her kumite. But she wasn’t ready. She wasn’t even dressed. How her nudity had gone uncommented upon she did not understand. She attempted to cover herself, but there were people all around.

You are Lucky, the curator said. It is a burden, you carry it. 

It is a gift, you carry that too, said Daewoo.

Hye you are late for kumite, said the Sifu.

But I have been here, thought Hye.

Just the same, you are late.

You are an asura, thought Hye.

You are pregnant, said the Sifu, you kept a secret. Soon a new life will emerge.

I am going to have a baby?

Are you ready to fight? It is time to kumite.

Hye looked down at her belly, cradling it in her hands. A new life. 

I don’t want to hurt the baby.

There is no baby for you to hurt. You are pregnant, said Daewoo, not with child.

A sharp pain lanced through Hye, as though a claw raked her from within.

And now you must fight. 

The words were the Sifu’s, her voice, but there stood an ogumo. Embedded in its jet black wasp head were huge compound eyes that shimmered a nacreous violet. The crowd did not run or cower. It walked over to the Vizier’s desk, picked up the Vizier, and hurled her over the crowd. There was no sound as this happened. For Trine, the same, grabbing the fusion by its tail and tossing it like a bolo skyward. It then smashed the desk. From within the rubble, it pulled a coin, and tossed it at her feet.

Hye ran at it, desperate, furious, and swung. Her fist moved as if underwater, striking the ogumo with barely a tap. Again and again she swung, each hit harder, but all as gentle as a caress. The ogumo slashed her belly. Hye heard herself screaming. But no blood came, only the orange-red translucence of agar, then a head. It was the Sifu’s, eyes blazing.

“You cannot win.” The head spoke.

The ogumo grabbed Hye’s shoulders with its lower claws and removed its helmet with its upper, revealing the Sifu beneath. Her eyes were a blazing royal purple, there was no white. The Vizier, crawling, dragged herself by her hands through the crowd. 

The ogumo grabbed Hye’s head with its upper claws, forcing her to look at the Sifu’s face. Bracing the lower claws against her shoulders, talons digging into her temple, neck, and jaw, it began to pull.

Advika hunched in front of the security monitors, her dark face lit by their glow. In the grainy images, she had watched it build its awful assembly line of corpse-sourced calories. Through what remained of that first night, and well into the first day it butchered, roasted, boiled, and ate. Worse was yet to come. 

A safe room is a strange thing. A prison cell of one’s own choosing, with the threat locked out rather than in. That descriptor, ‘safe’, depends on an asymmetry of power; the threat must be weaker than the room. Busaws were a solution to that problem. They required time, food, and their own window of peace before pealing open the hidden steel door like an orange rind. Those first early hours, maybe the first day, they could have stopped it. Now that she knew what it was, how it behaved, together she and Hye could have overpowered it.

But instead, Hye and Winji had lain in their cots, writhing in fever. Winji’s wounds alone should have been fatal. Survival was miraculous on its own, her ability to cry for help and fight a fever of agar-aided microbes beggared belief. Maybe in a real hospital, with an agar soak and a phalanx of antibiotics and anti-virals marshaled in her defense the starry Nubian Ambassador could have come out the other side, battered but no less brilliant. Advika sat with her in the final minutes, holding her hand. Winji’s breath came in short, shallow, spasmed gasps—then one long final exhale. She died before noon. Advika shrouded her in sheets. You will be with your people for your rites, the old woman whispered, but first we must escape this place.

By the end of the first evening, Hye had fought off most of the fever, only to have it return all the more lurid again that second night. She mumbled and twitched. One moment, sweat poured from her face and palms, her hair clinging to forehead and cheeks; the next, she was pallid and shivering, lips near blue. 

So much as she could, when not nursing Hye, the Sifu slept. The security monitors showed nothing she had not anticipated. The silent alarm button stared at her, a taunting red glowing eye. In the quiet hours, rumination took her back to the details the Zaqqum had disclosed. She mulled the facts. The precise wording of their arrangement. That the Host hated to lose. Victory is most often smuggled into defeat as revenge. Busaw were now as extinct as ogumo. The Society was involved. Hye was not supposed to have been with her. Only in a trap do things go so right before going so very wrong.

Hye was again lucid on the second morning. Weakened, but her eyes were clear. She ran her fingers over the raised gashes on her cheek and forehead.

“Did Winji?”

Advika could not help but smile through her tears.

“No,” said the Sifu, rubbing slow, stabilizing circles on the Ward’s back. “But you have. Your sister would have asked if the scars were permanent. You ask about a woman you’d only met hours before.”

“Are they?”

“I don’t know. Few survive busaw wounds. Agar is powerful, but—”

“Busaw?”

“In a moment. Your foot?”

Hye lay back, the Sifu holding her foot and calf so the ankle was at eye level.

“Sprain, I think. A break would have had more swelling.”

Hye winced, swallowing a scream as a stammered whisper, as the Sifu manipulated the joint. Advika furrowed her brow.

“Bad sprain, then. How do you feel?”

“I still feel as though I could sleep for a century. But I don’t want to sleep.”

“There is no where we can go, yet. Running may be involved. Rest.”

“I had weird dreams,” Hye mumbled, eyes already half lidded.

“The fever is gone. You’ll sleep peaceful.”

Cannibalistic monsters could be found in almost every culture’s legends. Graveyard-haunting ghouls, forest-dwelling wendigos, city-lurking hungry ghosts—each their emissary of the demon world, an example of what waits for those who stray from the path. Among them, the busaw: corpse-stealer. That such a fiend could become fodder for a Long War boffin was not the worst horror. No that was nature’s prerogative. 

Hye could see, well as her Sifu, that it had *grown*. Moon was not a bulky man and, within hours of his ghastly corruption, had thinned further. Now, however, that-which-was-once-moon, hulked. Limbs had become thick with muscle and wrapped in pachydermous skin. What had been human was not decaying, but becoming buried under mutation and malformation. There was no denying the new growths, tusk like teeth now jutted in random directions from the jaw, cheeks rent apart, dangling in shreds. Spurs of bone erupted at random through skin.

“These don’t die on their own, do they?”

“Everything dies, Hye,” said the Sifu, “no life can sustain forever. There is something about the process that we do not understand. Even with agar. Command as we do each rung of the double helix, such potency is nothing against the overwhelming need for renewal. Busaws are metabolism set to max with the knob ripped off. Non-essential things, like cartilage and moral processing centers are consumed. For aswangs, it’s just adrenaline and cortisol—pure rage and fury, ready to kill anything that moves. No living thing can maintain that long, the very things that make it strong consume and obliterate it. Busaws are that brutality refined. Two simple drives of foundational biology set into overdrive.”

“Hunger and…growth?”

The Sifu nodded.  “What is growth out of control?”

“Cancer. That’s why it… looks that way.”

“Antlers are bone cancer made to do evolution’s bidding. Busaws are similar.”

“Is that why it is patrolling? It… it knows someone is in the safe room?”

“Possibly. Or it has a memory of something important being behind this wall. Or it can smell us. I don’t know.”

“We won’t be able to escape. I’ll miss the duel. They’ll wait till we’re all dead.”

“No. The risk profile has shifted. Busaws are not infectious. Their senses are heightened, yes, but their ability to plan and anticipate is limited to whatever mind they possess. Moon was a decent man, but no military tactician.”

“We’re going to fight it? The armory!”

“Yes. We have to get to the armory. Hopefully they left us something.”
