Late for kumite again, Hye waddled with urgency through the palace halls. Her bare-footed padding across the tile echoed, making the whole place seem cavernous. Where was everyone? In the next room, a vaulted ballroom with only a desk and chair in the center, was Vizier Daewoo. A large clock on the wall ticked loudly. On the desk was Trine, one of their mice looking at the Vizier, engaged in conversation, while the other two turned to watch Hye approach. They greeted her with little chirrups and bobbing heads.

Hye pressed one hand into the small of her back, resting the other on her swollen, taught belly.

How long, the Vizier asked.

She asked the mouse, but it was directed at Hye, she was sure of it. Why wouldn’t Daewoo look at her.

How long have you known, she asked, how long until it comes out?

Hye looked down at her own belly. It was huge now—though it felt like only days, she must have known for longer. Pregnancy takes months, she remembered. The undertaking alters the mother, permanently. There were pictures in every text, explaining how difficult act of creation was on the creator, for the created. But with artificial wombs, that was no longer a difficulty.

An odd choice, then, the Vizier pointed, for you to carry one. Why?

A swirl as the soon-to-be-born turned in her, its elbows and knees, heels and palms, pressing into her kidney, her spine, her bladder. The clock stopped.

I’m late for kumite.

You plan to fight in that condition?

That voice—Sun. The princess was in her royal finest, fit for enthronement. She sauntered across the stones of the kumite ring, the breeze rustling the trees on the mountainside behind them. It was strange that the Vizier’s desk was in the middle of the ring. Trine looked at Hye and Sun, then all three mice crawled into the Vizier’s hand. Palm up, she lifted the fusion to eye level. Studying each other they both turned to her.

You plan to fight in that condition? They repeated.

Hye turned to Sun to ask where she had been, but she had already walked off, the edges of her robes disappearing around a curve in the path to the council chambers. She felt hot, exhausted. How was she going to fight? She was late for kumite. Within her, a kick, her belly distorting here, then there, as another came. A spasm racked her. Not a contraction, but was it?

A crowd had gathered, all of the council, other royals, even the mayor from her village. The Curator was there, and the Mandarin Bok. Here to watch her kumite. But she wasn’t ready. She wasn’t even dressed. How her nudity had gone uncommented upon she did not understand. She attempted to cover herself, but there were people all around.

You are Lucky, the curator said. It is a burden, you carry it. 

It is a gift, you carry that too, said Daewoo.

Hye you are late for kumite, said the Sifu.

But I have been here, thought Hye.

Just the same, you are late.

You are an asura, thought Hye.

You are pregnant, said the Sifu, you kept a secret. Soon a new life will emerge.

I am going to have a baby?

Are you ready to fight? It is time to kumite.

Hye looked down at her belly, cradling it in her hands. A new life. 

I don’t want to hurt the baby.

There is no baby for you to hurt. You are pregnant, said Daewoo, not with child.

A sharp pain lanced through Hye, as though a claw raked her from within.

And now you must fight. 

The words were the Sifu’s, her voice, but there stood an ogumo. Embedded in its jet black wasp head were huge compound eyes that shimmered a nacreous violet. The crowd did not run or cower. It walked over to the Vizier’s desk, picked up the Vizier, and hurled her over the crowd. There was no sound as this happened. For Trine, the same, grabbing the fusion by its tail and tossing it like a bolo skyward. It then smashed the desk. From within the rubble, it pulled a coin, and tossed it at her feet.

Hye ran at it, desperate, furious, and swung. Her fist moved as if underwater, striking the ogumo with barely a tap. Again and again she swung, each hit harder, but all as gentle as a caress. The ogumo slashed her belly. Hye heard herself screaming. But no blood came, only the orange-red translucence of agar, then a head. It was the Sifu’s, eyes blazing.

“You cannot win.” The head spoke.

The ogumo grabbed Hye’s shoulders with its lower claws and removed its helmet with its upper, revealing the Sifu beneath. Her eyes were a blazing royal purple, there was no white. The Vizier, crawling, dragged herself by her hands through the crowd. 

The ogumo grabbed Hye’s head with its upper claws, forcing her to look at the Sifu’s face. Bracing the lower claws against her shoulders, talons digging into her temple, neck, and jaw, it began to pull.
