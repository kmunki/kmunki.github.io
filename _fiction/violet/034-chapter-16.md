Leaning against the back wall, Illapa watched as the attendees poured in for Uplift’s Opening Ceremonies. The music in Tanganyika Auditorium was filled with pounding, up-beat indie synth designed to keep attendees hyped as they found their seats. Badges twisted on lanyards. Journalists set up their cameras on tripods, already documenting the vibe of the crowd as they waited for it all to begin. Panoramic views of the surrounding Kenyan edge-lands were obscured as curtains drew over the glass walls to the left and right. The house lights brightened and then dimmed almost completely. The crowd hushed, save the furious chittering sounds of pens and pencils scribbling. Illapa was already bored.

Uplift—once a bastion of Valley oddballs and tech weirdos—now seemed to strain out these impurities via corporate performance. Journalists were little better, either defanged or desensitized, they mistook advertisements and vaporware promises for news, for a story. No, the real stories were the little interactions *between* the propaganda speeches about false futures. 

Listen, never talk—Illapa’s iron clad rule here. Valley cant took some decoding. Observe, calculate the trajectories of braggarts and sycophants with social orbital mechanics. Know the gravity-wells of hands-on demos, the Lagrange points of talking-heads panels, the asteroid belts and solar flares of open-bar launch parties; map in mind Illapa could then navigate her way through this space to the stars she was here to see.

But for now, the lazy work of lurking.

The enormous projection screen on the stage erupted to life. On it a beautiful arial shot that soared over Lake Nyanza, then the Red Sea, and Kilimanjaro, herds of zebra and wildebeest, intercut with the names of the biggest companies on the planet. Blaring, exciting music rose to a crescendo as the words "Rift Valley Uplift” dropped onto the screen.

"Welcome," shouted a man's voice over the speakers. A slight, fit man in hoodie and jeans, his arms out wide, jogged onto the stage and grabbed the microphone stand yelling, "to Rift Valley Upliiift!" The crowd roared as he stretched the vowels, beaming.

"That's Danh Nguyen?" whispered an incredulous journalist to another through the din, "I’ve seen thousands of pictures and I don’t quite believe it. He's way taller than I expected."

Danh felt the wave of excitement wash over him. Embracing it, he held the mic more like a rockstar than a CEO, but that’s what Uplift was for, right? Rockstars of biotech. He clapped his hands together and held them out in front of him, poised as the audience calmed.

"Today begins the week of Uplift. My favorite time of the year." 

He grinned and scanned the room.

"For over eight decades, the Rift Valley has been the heart of global innovation. It all started right here," He pointed with both hands at the stage beneath him, "in Kenya. And not just Uplift. When you think world changing technology, you think the Valley. Consider mesh. Just outside Nairobi, in a small storage hut.” On the screen behind him it appeared, a standard hut, one of thousands around the perimeter of the Nyanja Arcology, which loomed in the background. 

"Angweng Chepchumba started the comms-tech revolution with a few solar cells and what would become the first mesh router. Her idea was, looking back, so simple.”

The screen changed again. A picture of Angweng, nineteen, her hair cropped short, big earrings framed her big smile as she was showing two older Kenyan men what she was working on, just a box and wires in the photo. The men were old enough to have been pre-teens when the war was ending. For many in the audience it wasn’t clear which was more amazing, seeing the first version of a device that had helped make modern life worth living or seeing two humans alive so old they could remember the war.

“Ang asked herself,” Danh continued, “ ‘Why couldn't the network for data work the way the old men of the village gossiped?’ They'd pass each other on the street, sharing little bits of hearsay, spreading news. Each person a node, holding some private information, holding even more to share with others. As they prodded their cows along they carried bits and bytes to the next village. Just like the villagers remembered who regularly went out to the remote herders, who might go weeks without seeing anyone, why couldn't a data network do the same? From out of her hut the modern world of communication was born!"

Huge applause as Angweng, one of the titans of tech and somewhere in the top ten of richest people on the planet, walked onto stage, waving at the crowd. She was on the list. An option, thought Illapa.

"Thank you Danh,” she said, her subtle Swahili accent lilting, "and welcome, everyone, to Rift Valley Uplift. I'm so excited to be here for the fortieth anniversary with all of you." More cheers.

"There is so much to discuss. We've got an amazing week ahead. In addition to old timers like Danh and myself, we've got the real stars, the new rising minds, here. We'll have workshops throughout the week, discussing sustainability, regulation, and sovereignty. All the big names are here: Condor Moray, Lychee, Corps Co, and more, all here to unveil their biggest, best tech for the coming year. Who's ready to get started?" 

Whoops and cheers came from the crowd in response.

“I thought so. Me too,” she grinned, white teeth flashing, “I’m *extra *delighted to get to share some surprise news with all of you.” She clasped her hands over her chest, pausing for effect. Even the most hardened journalists and cynical industry-types leaned forward. “Violet, our only guest that can claim status as a Sovereignty, will be making a special announcement on the last day of Uplift. Dr. Wen Li Xing Xiang herself will be here. When I pushed Li Xing for details, she simply said, ‘It will be of interest to everyone.’ Big words from a woman so famously reserved. And with that, enjoy Uplift!” Angweng pressed her hands together, then, waiving, she left the stage.

Like a spark into gunpowder the news ripped through the audience.

Violet in general and Li Xing herself did not over promise. For decades, even the most outrageous, astounding advancements were downplayed and understated. Illapa watched as journalists scribbled into their notepads, checking and rechecking their schedules. Did they have tickets to the closing ceremony? It was traditionally so prosaic, everyone wanting to be first, the closing sessions half-attended by also rans and leftovers. Now the entire week was bookended by Violet. Li Xing’s announcement had grabbed their attention in the first minute and would hold it until the last. A master stroke.

The ceremony continued, veering into the self-congratulatory pap of those who know the ceremony must last more than five minutes, yet have forgotten why. How much of human existence was just this; a mimicking pantomime of past traditions drained of meaning? Be it a sacrifice to the gods or a gathering of celebrities, the why over the years is lost, withering and drying like flowers on a grave. Soon enough the name on the headstone has faded and the appropriate flowers forgotten, but the ritual persists, the details getting lost amid the generational game of telephone.

Ah well, plenty of time after the mission to get philosophical about it. Where was Tir?
