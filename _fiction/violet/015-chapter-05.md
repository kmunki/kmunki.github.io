Four motos streaked across the Mongolian steppe, dust trails rising behind them. The knobby tires and heavy springs of Hye and Sun’s military-issue motos rumble and creaked as they hammered over the washboard dirt that constituted a road. 

A crackle came over their helmet radios, “We’re well into edge-land now,” said the General, “we’ll be at the arc soon enough. Stay vigilant.”

Between the wilds and proper Koryo were the edge-lands. At the Long Wars apex—where ferocity, cynicism, and destructive capacity together touched the tops of their parabolas—armies and nations applied “if not us, no one” logic in burning swaths, scarring the continents. Life itself became the weapon. Whole new hostile ecosystems were created and unleashed, like an eating, breathing minefield. Almost a century since and still over half, maybe more, of every continent was Wilds or edge-land, too dangerous for anything resembling real civilization to persist.

“Edge-lands!” Hye repeated. For the first time in her life she was beyond the border of Koryo proper. 

“Thought you said this was our territory now, General,” said Adivka, “first you come to the Viceroy begging for an old woman to do you job for you, when you can’t get that, you settle for fledglings, now you tell me you can’t even keep us safe?” 

The old Sifu had insisted on bringing her own moto. It was a liquid black crystalline thing, two shards of angled chiton-carbon alloy. The seat cantilevered over the huge rear wheel, giving the effect of the rider all-but-floating just above the tires and motor. Rumors among the palace staff said that it was stolen from a spy she had killed; that it had hidden compartments.

“Zhongguo would have killed us all weeks ago. We’re safe enough. I took it, Princess’ problem to keep it.”

“And I will,” said Sun, “Hye, focus, please. Gawk on the way home, no distractions until we have a deal. Sifu, you trained me for this, let me show I was paying attention. General, just get us there.”

“This isn’t just about you, Princess,” said the General. “Koryo needed this. The arc’s not too far. Hard to see but it’s those hills,” the General continued, pointing at a low clutch of mounds indistinguishable from every other on the steppe horizon. 

“The Olgoi-Khorkhoi Arcology is a hard place,” said the Sifu, “The General and Viceroy are too confident. As they tried to order me, they want to order the Olgoi. It is filled with people for whom the Long War’s Shadow was wide and dark. Sun, Jee and the Viceroy *need *you and I to hold the arc for it to be worth anything. It requires diplomacy and toughness, silk draped over steel. You will need to be both.”

Jee slowed her moto, hunting for a little marker, a stick with a bit of stained orange rag tied to it. Finding it, she rolled to a stop.

“Princess Seong-ma, Ward Hyeon, Sifu Shidao,” said General Jee with exaggerated formal bow, “welcome to the edge-lands. Though perhaps for you, Sifu, I should say welcome home?”

Advika let out a grumbling mock-laugh as she pulled her helmet off. All were clad in fatigues, now dust covered and sweaty. Removing their helmets had pulled their hair slightly out of the tight, practical braids they wore. For the first time, Hye could see that these were not-quite hills. About a hundred meters away, weathered steel sides were just visible. Near the base of the closest structure, a herd of large brown wooly cows were lowing and grazing. She was about to step past the General to get a closer look, but both Jee and Advika put a hand out to stop her.

“Please Ward Hyeon,” said the Stump, “follow close. The security hybrids aren’t aware of our presence yet. They are not smart things despite the arc’s hybreeders best efforts. We’ll walk the safe path.” She gestured to sticks shoved into the ground in a winding path leading towards the arc and began walking.

“What am I walking into?” Sun asked.

“The Olgoi? The usual. They’re not idiots,” the General said, “the Arc Chief, a few of what I guess pass for mandarins here, other core leaders; they all seem to get it. Not *pleased*, no. Who is to be conquered? From what we can gather the Zhongguo were real bastards and struggled up here. Even with Beijing so close they didn’t offer much protection from raids or the Wilds. So we’ve got that going for us. They know we could kill all of them if we felt like it. They also know we can’t run the arc without them, which would mean no agar.”

“Like you said, not idiots,” Advika agreed.

Hye was awestruck as they approached. From a distance, the arcology had seemed perhaps the size of the palace. Yet as they walked closer it towered—perhaps a hundred meters high and over a kilometer long. This closest building was just one among many comprising the whole. Hye could barely imagine a single arcology of this scale being built, let alone hundreds of them, each with a unique design, in places all around the planet, in just a few decades. The outside was coated with a fur of brown lichen and yellowing grasses. She could see land crabs skittering up and down the sides, their dusty claws and flittering antennae in constant motion, searching for threats to the infrastructure and nibbling on the withered vegetation. Pruning sheers with appetites, Advika had called them once in an effort to dissuade a much younger Hye from attempting to make a pet of one she found on the palace grounds. Both failed in their endeavors.

A door opened in the huge facade and a woman walked out, like watching an ant emerge from an aubergine. Even from a distance the woman’s distinctive walk betrayed an almost joyous self confidence. Her shoulders were back, chest out, arms wide and swinging freely, her legs kicking out in front and flopping down. She strode to them directly, ignoring the markings of the safe path. This was her territory. She was draped in a practical cape, under which were patched and stained coveralls.

“Sain baitsgaanoo!” the woman bellowed, her voice high and gravely. In response came a lowing from the wooly oxen grazing near by and perhaps the single largest creature either Hye had encountered in their life came loping over, as though it were a puppy instead of a two ton, meter-horned, shaggy bovine. The woman laughed gregariously and pet them. Together, woman and beast started up the path towards their visitors.

“Ah, this is the Arc Chief now, Bolormaa,” General Jee said, then dropped her voice for just the tutor, “and if she has a surname she doesn’t care to share it or use it.”

“The ox?” Advika asked.

“Just your average wooly ox,” said the Stump, missing the joke and living up to her nickname once again. “Not a hybrid, though you’d think it since they’re rather dog-like up here. All the open space and the relative safety of the arc leads them to hang around. Not quite domesticated, but something of a casual symbiosis. The arc-ers avoid eating them.”

“Don’t want to become dependent on external rations?” Asked Sun.

“A savvy observation!” Shouted Bolormaa. What hearing! “Yes, ol’ Nohaj here would be as tasty as is friendly. But not habit we can afford to build. War in the morning!”

“Tomorrow?” Sun asked, stressed. 

The Sifu huffed a single laugh, “it’s a saying. Be prepared.”

“Welcome to Mongolia, oh rulers” said Bolormaa with an edge as she and the ox arrived in front of Jee, “you come to inspect your spoils. We of the Olgoi-Khorkhoi are eager to inspect you as well”

“Thank you for your generosity, Survivor Bolormaa,” said Sun, bowing and touching her knees with her finger tips, “for inviting us out of the wilderness and into your refuge.” Hye and Advika followed suit.

Bolormaa raised an eyebrow, “Well you are not Rus or Zhong, true! No mistakes though, civvy conquerors with manners are still conquerors. Your pointed guns are your invites, we do not decline because we, yes, are survivors, not fools. Nohoj would crush you to dust and I would laugh, were it not to follow with her death and my own.”

“Arc Chief Bolormaa,” said General Jee, stepping forward, “the Joseon representatives from Koryo, on behalf of the Continuum, Princess Yi Seong-ma, Ward Yi Hyeon Bong-cha, and Sifu Advika Shidao.”

Bolormaa looked at all three for a moment, then back at the General, “Continuum sends a codger and two ecto-fresh to negotiate terms,” she bellowed with laughter, then in Mongolian, *you civvy-forgetters get worse every year*.

*Builder words from a babysitter*, said Advika, in response. The color drained from the Arc Chief’s face. “You do not have to like us,” the Sifu continued, “But we’ve yet to disrespect you.”

Hye, curious about the great beast, held a hand forward to Nohaj. Curious in kind, it lumbered over, snuffled hugely, and licked her hand. She pressed her other palm to its huge brow. It closed its eyes and sighed.

“Nohoj likes that one,” said Bolormaa, chastened and shifting topics, “come.” She began walking back to the arc. Nohoj grunted a small huff and turned to follow with the rest.

“Agar production good,” Bolormaa began, anticipating the heart of the questioning, “but troubles. Arc defended, but hard to transport surplus reactant. Between here and there, many troubles. Swarms.”

“Swarms?” Asked Hye, incredulous, “I thought that was exaggerated, to scare us.”

“No, Ward Hyeon—“

“Just ‘Hye’ is ok, the title feels off out here, Arc Chief” she said to Bolormaa.

The General looked back and nodded. Well trained. Humble herself, respect the chief. Most royals can’t adjust that quickly.

“Hye then. Yes, swarms are real. Mostly—“

“Let her guess, please, Arc Chief,” interjected Advika, “perhaps even they forget less than you imagine.”

“You were briefed?” Bolormaa asked as they stood at the threshold of the huge structure, a tiny open door in a wall twenty times its height. The question was more to the General than to Hye.

The General shook her head, looking to the tutor with equal confusion.

“No, Arc Chief” said Sun, with a sigh and wry smile, “our Sifu has told us once, sometime, heavens know when. She expects us to pull it from the depths of our memory.”

Hye thought for a moment, looking around. She knelt and used a finger to dig a furrow into the dirt. “Mmmmm….skorwevs in the dry season and,” Hye paused again, her mind rummaging through facts, “Burrow toads in the wet?”

The Arc Chief looked hard at the Ward. “Yes, Ward Hye, beetles and frogs. Few civvies could even guess. You seem certain.”

“What *are* you teaching them, Sifu?” Asked General Jee.

“To survive, General,” answered Hye, “The environment here is far to dry for scourers, which require a huge amount of foliage to sustain and tend to be a larger threat to tropic and subtropic Wilds, while we’re not far enough inland to prevent the monsoons from getting here, creating deluge conditions necessary for a week or so of cool, humid air and standing water. I think some of the grasses here have the right pH for the burrow toads to maintain their caustic saliva.”

“Ho ho!” Laughed Bolormaa, “more surprises! Outside easier than in. Time for a real test.” They arrived at the looming wall of the arcology. Bolormaa shoed away the wooly ox and they stepped through into the Olgoi.
