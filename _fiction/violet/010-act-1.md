# Act 1: Ātmanic Exaptations

“Chance and destiny are equal villains. When history asks why, the former offers a glib *whatever;* the latter a cosmic *because I said so.* Both rob our shared past of meaning, of human volition – we wish to feel our hand in steering our lives and so jerk the rudder with the rampant speculation of *what if*. A favorite moment of such guesswork is of Zheng He’s Eighth Journey. A cliché, like the British Raj defeating the Indians, it often takes the shape of the Xuande Emperor’s 1435 illness being fatal instead of merely severe. No journey, thus the Mexhica, Inka, and the Golden East was not encountered for another half century or more, and then by the shaggy barbarians of Mediterranean Europe. 

Now I enjoy a good tale as much as Scheherazade’s husband, but from here the extrapolation becomes wild; with inventions of massive plagues, conquest and, most fanciful, that the Long War never occurred. While ridiculous and impossible to validate, such counterfactuals are a speculative scale where the full weight of Zheng He and the Xuande’s decision to continue the treasure voyages with a new target across the Great Ocean can be felt. This, my dear students, is why it is on the final. It is, in the strongest degree to which the metaphorical phrase can be taken literally, a pivotal moment in human history.”
