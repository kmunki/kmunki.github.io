The Siberian sky was a blistering blue. Hye fumbled for her sunglasses, found them in the qaliq pocket with Trine, and extricated them. Buildings, brutalist and squat, sat amidst glaring white snow. On the streets between, clad in anoraks and snow suits, were people. More than she could count at a glance. Snow-motos and polar bears dragged sleds stacked with bags of rice or barrels of vat stock. A mammoth, its tusks clad in crocheted finery, paused to allow shoppers a better look at the wears that hung from the great shelves down its sides. Novy Urengoy: a city in the Wilds.

“On time!” Croaked a voice.

There stood a Dire and Baikal Wapiti, each seeming more cousin to bear and mammoth than wolf or elk. Across the milky left eye of the wolf, a scar. On one of the great branching antlers of the elk sat an eagle-sized raven with a marbled yellow and black beak.

“The herdpack…” Hye backed away a step, “you…”

The Dire that had watched from the river. The imperious elk shook its head, dislodging the bulky bird, which flapped for a moment, circling in irritation before landing in front of Hye. It shot a glance over its shoulder—half in frustration, half in fear—at the looming guardians.

“Totem?”

“Oh, yes, uh,” Hye fished through her pack, and, finding the totem, presented it, “here. From the Zaqqum. Proof of their protection and to grant us passage home.”

The Dire wolf approached and gently lifted the carved antler from Hye’s hand with its jaws.

Both elk and wolf nodded a *so be it *to their guests and went separate ways, folding into the thronging Siberian streets. The sea eagle raven watched them leave then heaved a sigh.

“Time to fly!” She spread her huge black wings in excitement. They were as far apart as Hye was tall. “Follow! Follow!” Launching into the air, the raven circled and landed on a near by roof at the corner of an intersection, and screech-croaked, “Follow!”

Within several blocks, the city became quiet, abandoned. Buildings had been allowed to decay. A dead skeleton around a beating heart. Camouflage, she realized. Hybrids and humans were packed into the center, the invisible edge of town agreed upon and understood. Beyond that line what buildings were there  belonged to the withering of time and elements. Among them, the herdpack. The caribou and wolves filled the streets and took shelter from the wind in the lees. Anyone fool enough to brave the Wilds would give the city wide berth. An abandoned city? That’s worth exploring, who knows what war-relics remain. An abandoned city taken over by a herdpack? Best keep moving. As they passed the last collapsed-in structures at the outer edge, more rubble than ruins, she half wondered if the inner city was a mirage. The sea-raven wheeled above, circling over a hill a ways off, almost indistinguishable amid the infinite flat white.

The raven cawed several times, like an alarm, before announcing, “Passengers!”

A perfectly hidden hatch opened in the snow. Had one opened in the sky, Hye could not have been more surprised. Sables and kolonoks emerged. The tube-ish mustelids rippled across the snow towards the huge mound. Following close behind were two saki monkeys. Thick white fur around their face was like a built-in parka hood, contrasting their black body fur.

There was a terrible grinding sound and the mound began to shudder. One side, a vast hidden door began to open. Another arcology? The hanger door slid back to reveal a huge machine within. The raven flew a few circles, cawing with delight, before landing. “The Bear,” it yelled, “The Bear!”

Within the hanger hidden within the mound was a titanic polished metal machine. Hye had seen them only in history books and museums. The body so like a bullet train locomotive of old. Outstretched from each side, wings.

“Is that…” 

“Yes,” said Advika, “an airplane.”

The monkeys and martens began clambering all over it, inspecting, sniffing, checking. The metal echoed and reverberated with their movements. From a little hut built into the side of the hanger came an old orangutan. She wore a shearling coat, the dark leather coated in military patches and insignias. Onto her head, she had pulled a leather aviator’s cap, the small domes of the ear cups sticking out ridiculously. She waved Hye and Advika over.

“You fly Koryo? Zakat pilot”—she tapped a finger on her chest—“Zakat fly Bear for you.” She pointed at the huge aircraft. “Zaqqum say, we do.”

Within the hanger, Hye felt like a gnat. The craft was massive. Its metal skin had been polished to a sheen. From its nose, a spine like a marlin’s. The wings were not straight out, as she’d always imagined, but were instead swept back, as though it were already roaring through the sky. On each were two massive engines, each with two stacked propellers, each blade was as tall as she was. The long tube of the fuselage had, just behind the crux of the wings, a bulge, like a snake having swallowed an egg of slightly larger circumference and it got stuck.

When people fly, be they gods or wuxia heroes, the thrill is tempered. Any winged or finned creature must justify its movement through the volume. Humans, though, we depict ourselves as levitating, because it is not a demonstration of the natural, but of the supernatural—some kind of otherworldly will, ability, or heritage. Meditate well enough, oh monk, and you shall float above the temple floor as you contemplate existence. Hye had always found planes in movies to seem equally strange. How could something so rigid, so immovable, so massive and metal, just lift itself into the air?

“Bear is aircraft,” ooked the orangutan, her voice deep and hoarse. She pulled at her beard as she tottered along, double-checking the inspection her crew was making. “Was Ruscraft design, Mongol make real. Better nuclear scientists. Bump,” she pointed to a bulge in the fuselage behind the wings, “is reactor. Power turboprops. Contra-rotating,” she splayed her huge hands, one just in front of the other, and waved them in opposite directions, “very powerful.”

Hye goggled, “did you say reactor?” She looked at the Sifu, desperate to be wrong.

The Sifu shrugged, “lead shielding is lighter than batteries. Unless you saw a fuel depot on our way over?”

“Can fly very long. Very very long—” her attention swung back to one of the Saki monkeys. She ooked and snapped her fingers, pointing vigorously at something for the crew hybrid to check.

“And you are the pilot?” Hye tried her best to sound as if she was stupid not terrified.

“Ook” the orangutan nodded vigorously, patting the cap and jacket with pride.

“Take all to fly. Are team. Saki”—she pointed at a monkey brachiating across the hanger roof, which then paused to dangle by an arm to get a better look at the tail fin and rudder—“copilot and Saki”—she pointed at the other, half inside a wheel well—“comms. Nav and tech are weasels.” She gestured broadly at the undulating mustelids. “Get in, we fly.”

For an instant, Hye once again felt as if she was beside the Olgoi. The craft was enormous, its polished aluminum fuselage gleamed in the arctic sun. Zakat pointed to an open door on its side. This is the path home, Hye told herself, and clambered inside. As she did, a thrill took hold of her. By the gods, she was going to fly. In an airplane. Few alive had ever even seen one, even in museums, forget a working one. Within it were a host of electronics that were wired to huge cylinders in the floor, each enveloped in tubes. Like the tower. She repressed the thought.

The pilot ooked her forward, into the cockpit. There, the Saki were already in position. A quiet hum began to emanate from the craft.

“Reactor,” said the Saki and gave a thumbs up to the pilot.

“Engines,” said the pilot, depressing a button on the console. Four of the martens appeared, each holding a pin as long as they were with a long red ribbon attached. She nodded approval. They slotted the pins into a holster then skittered to the windows, looking out as if hunting, then returned to their former spots and held their arms out like wings.

“Clear!” The pilot yelled once more into the comm, her ape voice booming through external hanger speakers. She flipped several switches, seemed to count in her head, then pushed four chunky buttons in series. Outside, the four double-stacked turbo-prop fans began to rotate. Seconds later, they were a deafening drone. One of the Saki handed Hye a headset, then to the Sifu. The drone faded and was replaced by the cacophonic radio chatter and squeaks of sables and kolonoks mixed with the ooks and hoots of the Saki. The great craft crawled out from its hanger onto the open field of white. Hye could see the great wolf and elk, the sea-raven once again perched on an antler, watching from the edge of the city. Zakat turned towards the open horizon.

“All ready?” The orangutan asked through the comm. An orderly sequence of replies, neither animal nor any language she knew, followed from what must have been every creature on the plane, save herself and the Sifu.

“All ready!”

With gusto, she dropped her leathery black hand onto the throttles, gripped them, and with a gleam in her eye, pushed them to max. The drone of the engines became howling roar. The craft seemed to strain against itself, remaining stationary for an instant. Then it lurched forward, Hye pressed into her seat as it accelerated.

“Boost ready?” The pilot yelled over the din as the Bear rattled over the snow and ice.

More chirrups and hoots of assent.

Zakat yanked the stick back and the Bear tilted skywards. She flicked up a cover on the console and smashed the button beneath. From behind them, an explosion and then bone-shaking thunder of rocket blast. Hye was crushed into her seat, as was the Sifu. The old woman gripped her thighs for stability, straining to breathe. She looked at the Ward, expecting to see her terrified. Hye’s eyes were wide, yes, but with unrestrained joy. They burst through a cloud, climbing up towards the sun.

Zakat took the Bear higher, well above the sparse clouds over Novy Urengoy. Her ears equalized just as they had within the Olgoi. Within minutes the here-and-there puffs turned to a vast sea of white. The craft’s shadow danced across the vaporous peaks. That shelf of white soon again opened, revealing windows to the tundra. With some deliberate physical geometry and a thoughtfully folded shirt, Hye was able to nestle her head within the bubble window beside her seat. Trine joined her, crawling from her pocket to make a nest among the spare shirt. Together they watched the Wilds below. A scorwev swarm twisted and undulated, a seething sculpture of black, separating and converging. A forest of pines were almost shaken free of snow as a hundreds strong herd of mammoth thundered from within it out onto the plain. There were lone creatures too—bear, moose, wolves—tiny at this distance, heralded by their long shadows cast across the glittering white by the low southern sun.

The low thrum of the engines settled into a steady rhythm. Another bank of clouds covered over the Wilds. Hye could not find it within her to stay awake, nor could she allow herself to miss a moment. She fought sleep, and lost.

When she next awoke it was dark. The cockpit glowed an eerie red from a dim constellation of dials and switches, gauges and indicator lights. The Sifu was not sitting up in her half sleep, one eye open. Instead, she was slouched against the window, her chest rising and falling in long slow beats. A small light on the ear cup — her headset was switched to silent. For the first time since the attack, she had let herself relax. Finally, thought Hye, real sleep. For both of us.

 Looking again out the bubble window, her eyes fast adjusted to the night. Stars sprayed across the sky. Off to the far edge, at the horizon, she could see the thin string of lights streaking across the tundra: a train. Ahead of it, almost out of sight, a pocket of brightness indicating a battery town. How she wished she could tell them all—look up! We still fly! The war left us wings yet. But no one looked to the skies anymore and the Bear flew dark. Even the most curious star gazer would only see a moving speck of black against the stars and subtle aurora. A glint from below caught her eye and Hye looked straight down, her crown pressed to the outermost of the bubble window. Beneath were more lights. Against the pervading black, even a wanderer with a flashlight could have stood out, but there were dozens. The train did not branch and this was fifty, if not a hundred kilometers from the train. From the spacing of the lights, it was larger than a battery town. *Another city*, she realized. Not huge, certainly no larger than Novy Urengoy, but another city in the Wilds.

Zakat had leaned back in her pilot’s seat, hands behind her head, one thumbed foot on the yolk.

“Is that a city?” Hye whispered into her mic.

The ape startled slightly, adjusted a dial on her headset, and replied, “Yes. Forget name. That nav job.”

“Are they,” Hye struggled with how to put it, “friendly?”

A soft hooting came from the orangutan—she was chuckling. “Yes. All city in these Wilds friends to each other. Most loyal to Zaqqum. Novy most. If not friend”—Zakat held up one hand, pinky and thumb akimbo, a pantomime plane, then from below it, extended a single finger on her other hand and make a rocket sound, launching into the flying hand—“boom. No other planes. Only Bear. Only Zakat.”

A somber moment of quiet passed between them. 

“Every city?” Hye asked. “There are more than two?”

“Wilds big. Much danger. Many people go in. Want wealth, treasure—” the ape leaned back in her chair to look Hye in the eye, “—escape, freedom. Very few ever leave. Everyone say, ‘they die, Wilds kill.’ But no one find bodies, no one come look.”

Zakat turned back to watch the sky. A ghostly ribbon of green curled among the stars, off to the north. Streaks rose from it, flickering and dancing, an ethereal curtain of inverted icicles of light. It cast no glow nor shadow, the tundra below as moonlit as before.

“Aurora,” said Zakat, pointing, “rare. More common in Novy. Dance of spirits. Or of memories. In Novy, we say is memory of life before, of big city lights. Of civilization. Of what left behind.”

For minutes, Hye watched the luminous green flickers and whirls amid the star-speckled black. The pale ember of Pyongyang, a weak beacon of hope after horror and freezing rain, appeared in her mind.

“I see what you mean,” said Hye. “I was not expecting to fly, Zakat. I did not know any working planes still existed. If I see the aurora next, I won’t remember a city. I will remember this.”

Zakat shifted in her seat, sitting a bit more upright. Hye caught the corner of the orangutan’s lips raise in a subtle smile. “Zaqqum does not fly others. Bear for power. Special. You are lucky. ”

Hye looked south, turning away from the otherworldly shimmer above the Wilds, and into yawning darkness of the midnight horizon.

“I hope you’re right,” she said.
