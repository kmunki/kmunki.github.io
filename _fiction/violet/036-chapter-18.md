Abutting the auditorium was a vast balcony. Illapa slipped out of the ceremonies and into a light breeze and bright sun. Sweeping an arc from one side of the egg to the other, it functioned as an external promenade. As within, groups of attendees, presenters, and reporters strolled and clustered along the balcony. The excuse for sunglasses was welcome, making it ever so slightly easier to scan about with discretion. Again Illapa searched, and again found little of note. Famous, perhaps, wealthy, likely, powerful, true, some were, but none on the list—no mutual target. To hunt a predator, one must first hunt their prey.

But wait, who’s this now? 

Leaning against the railing was a woman in a brown trench, collar up, one hand pressing her hat to her head against a gust that pulled and played with her long black hair. She turned inward, her body curled around a cigarette, held to her lips, as the other hand fished in her pocket. Where was the damn thing? There was only so much room per pocket and only so many pockets in the coat, gods she just—and then there was a flame in front of her, a stranger’s hand cupping it. She leaned forward to accept, looking past the light to the lighter. A woman, with a wry smile and sharp green eyes, a little age in her face and ghosts of scars deep enough even agar couldn’t erase them. New World, she guessed, likely Inkan. There was a hint of cruelty in the smile, of coldness in the eyes. She inhaled, and leaned back, o-ed her lips, and exhaled luxuriously.

“And who might I thank for the light?” The woman in the trench asked.

“Agent Illapa, Condor Moray” said Illapa, flicking closed her lighter and pocketing it. “Kimia Tir?”

“Guilty. Rather bold, aren’t you agent? And this,” she gestured to the ambiance of Uplift, “not a usual haunt, is it?”

Illapa held a cigarette to her own lips, then touched the end to Tir’s. Tir drew in and her cigarette’s end ember glowed orange, lighting the other. Illapa mirrored, then leaned back, and reflected Tir’s own first exhalation.

“Me? No, I come every year. Wouldn’t miss it,” Illapa grinned at the auditorium behind them, then back to Tir, “Though I must admit what’s on display this year is exceptional. I’m particularly interested in your speech. Theoretical applications of agar in zero gravity. Your papers were fascinating. I wouldn’t have guessed that even low gravity could have meaningful changes.”

“Nor would most. Agar, as much as we use it, is not even remotely understood. At the biochemical level it’s a mystery. I admit, though, I’m impressed, agent,” she said, half-laughing, “you’ve done your homework. Though I can’t imagine what I’ve done to earn the attention of the Inka.”

“You’ve earned *my* attention,” said Illapa, taking a drag and then waiving the cigarette dismissively, “I don’t know about the Inka.”

“Aren’t I the lucky one?”

“It’s looking that way, isn’t it?”

“You know, it is. For example, my session isn’t for hours. I was planning on attending some other talks, which I no longer want to do, now that you’ve arrived to keep me company.”

“Ah, what ever shall we do instead?”

“My hotel room is just…” She pointed to a balcony a few floors down, on another building, “perhaps we can evaluate our options from there?”
