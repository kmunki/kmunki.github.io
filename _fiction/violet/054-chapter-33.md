*Our best lead is the Malian mercenary group Blade of Kahina. We’ve set up a meeting with you to speak with their corporate security representative, Sadiya ibnat Tanaz al-Mzab, under the guise of augmenting Condor Moray’s security. She is smart, knows it, and is proud of it. Arrogant. Preening. Extremely dangerous. The meeting has been arranged in City Lower. No cover identity. Try to avoid trouble. And gambling. Learn whatever you can about Violet. Good luck.*

Vidya’s misplaced prophylaxis against a bit of fun not withstanding, the intel was good. And city-lower, how exciting! Her dalliances with Tir and the lemur had not left time to enjoy Nairobi’s full stack of delights. 

Moving from city-mid to upper, well that was a luxury. Stretching from the Pinnacle down to Central Station were stunning express elevators capable of carrying over a hundred people in a go—a vertical metro system. Illapa watched as the suited business women and robed dignitaries strolled by on their way to close critical deals, to glad-hand their way to better trade, or to quiet some unfortunateness at a border. 

Nearly everyone who came and went from Nairobi was in business or diplomacy—elevator people, going up. Those who came for business or pleasure less pristine, however, took the escalators to city lower. Hundreds of escalators zigzagged down nearly sixty stories. They diverged and roamed, like probing roots, entwined with external stairwells and ladders.

Illapa observed them as she descended. One woman, had emerged from her private car surrounded by a tight formation of stern looking professionals who were met by their doppelgängers, all now clustered together. Others, up-and-comers, were their own protection or were greeted by a single accomplice. Only one hybrid, a gorilla, made her presence obvious. A small woman came up to her and presented a ticket. The gorilla turned and headed toward the escalators, paused, made a gesture of *after you*.

Illapa had heard some claim that there was a *realness *to city-lower, but in many ways this was also, unfortunately, a *wildness—*contaminated from below. In city-mid, and certainly upper, no matter how angry someone became, how irate or furious, a physical altercation in public was unheard-of; this was in no small part due to the people who lived there describing a brawl as a ‘physical altercation’ and, were one to occur, gasping and saying ‘this is unheard-of!’ Humans are remarkably good at *not* being animals. Our emotions can, as we need them to, sit behind a series of barriers and filters, waiting patiently for expression. 

Conversely, hybrids cannot do this. Before hybridization, dozens of species had demonstrated rational intelligence: future thinking, causal-chain deduction, and multi-step puzzle solving. Dozens of species had also shown profound emotion: empathy, grief, kindness, and selflessness. What animals cannot do, however, is be repressed. An irritated human is, in some ways, several layers of abstraction wrapped around an irritated primate. An irritated hybrid chimpanzee is a single layer of abstraction wrapped around an irritated primate. That lone layer is language. The chimp can insult you or, maybe, if you’re lucky, walk away, furious. And in city-lower, the humans are not much different. People are passionate, loud, vulgar, and, as a matter of habit, very much *themselves* most of the time, regardless of their species.

Which is to say, it was not the *act* of the crows ordering a piece of pizza, it was the *argument* between two *species, *both equally animated and belligerent, that told Illapa she had truly arrived in city-lower. 

The pizza-maker shouted that the crows had used up their credit line, to which the crows responded that she was, in fact, a jerk. They don’t even like eating there. But they do eat it! That’s a favor to the chef! Where is the credit for a favor? The crows talked over each other, piling phrases and ideas on top of one another. Fine! The pizza maker yelled, you want? Here! She hurled a slice into the chasm between buildings. The crows launched after it. A brave one pulled her wings close and dove. She snatched the slice, which was nearly as large as she was, and unable to hoist it, decelerated sufficiently and glided to a stairwell landing. Her compatriots joined her and proceeded to begin squawking and cawing, first victoriously, then angrily at the question of how to divvy up the slice.

Nairobi was not a quiet city regardless of level, but thickened as one drew closer to the foundation. In addition to the hawkers, hustlers, and buskers on the outer landings and walkways, city-lower was the only part of Nairobi where one could find space on which to drive a moto. Describing the perforated sheetmetal as “streets” was a bit too generous, and, moreover, their piecemeal and not entirely legal construction lead to an un-mappable warren of rattling, dented pathways. Matatus and tuktuks, painted riotous colors and barnacled with trinkets, made liberal use of chirping horns that augmented their drivers’ insults and exculpations. Hybrids were everywhere, be they brachiating across scaffolding and signage, perched and flapping on the same, or perambulating with the crush of humanity. 

The final ingredient was the encroachment of the jungle from the *laison* below. Paths were coated with almost invincible moss, signs dangled with vines, flowers sprouted from seams and cracks, trees and ferns and huge-leafed greenery of all kinds found a way to thrive under the blaze of neon, blinking advertisements, and walls of scrolling LED. As Illapa turned off a main path onto a quieter one, she pushed through drooping fronds and stepped over roots. The pervading humidity condensed onto the cool leaves and metal, creating a perpetual dripping.

Along the walk way were numerous signs—neon grenades, flashing offers of bulk discounts, travel and meals included, discounts and more. The Mercenary District was, like all the others, offering a product and competing with their neighbors for your attention and currency. Illapa tried to imagine what position she would be in where she could afford mercenaries but also just decide to drop in without an appointment, based on the enticement of “first two hundred rounds on us.” In Nairobi, you could window-shop your way to world power, if the signs were to be believed.

At the end of the block, which was really where the walk way stretched across a gap to the next building, she found the sign. It was old and wooden plaque, lit by two spotlights that stuck out from above the door. Looked more like a shingle for a pub than a prestige mercenary house. Then again, what *should *it have looked like? She went in.

Inside was a lone woman writing at a desk. The room itself was clean, dimly lit with soft orange light. Windows, high enough such that they were above pedestrian traffic, let in the shifting, multicolored glow of the city. There was a small reception area, which had a Moroccan aesthetic of low couches, sitting cushions, with round tables. A single massive rug nearly carpeted the entire floor. The walls were simple tile, with the occasional patterned one here or there at random. 

The woman, who had been writing in a large ledger of some kind, looked up. She was west African and wore a formal outfit like a paramilitary dress uniform. Not a hair of her fulani high braided bun was out of place.

“One moment,” she said, then, gesturing to the couch, “Please.”

She returned to her writing. Her movements and posture were deliberate. The pen’s sweep across the paper was balletic and not without flourish. She finished, closed the large ledger book with a loud thump and moved it to a precise spot on the desk, and placed her pen in its holder, flaring her fingers as if sprinkling it there. She stood and came around from behind the desk.

“You must be Illapa of Condor Moray,” she said, extending a hand with a raised eyebrow and sly grin, “how I have been looking forward to meeting you.”

Illapa stood and they shook. The woman gestured for Illapa to again sit, then sat herself opposite.

“I am Sadiya. I have additional names but, I trust, you know them and the residual formalities of our respective titles and roles. Let’s move ourselves to the more interesting portion of the conversation presently: How can The Blade help a Sovereignty as big and powerful as Condor Moray? You have that Inkan military lurking around just outside the picture. We are hardly much of an addition. Unless…” Sadiya bobbled her head back and forth, as if she were contemplating something better left unsaid.

“Some things you leave to your top talent,” said Illapa, “Others, you contract out.”

“Your words wound me!” Said Sadiya, chuckling, “How mean you all have become since getting into bed with those nasty Keralans. You’ll come to regret that, I suspect. They rather disapprove of your methods. Can you imagine, no winnowing?”

“It is hard,” said Illapa, “seeing how many of my own brood didn’t survive to adolescence. Though things among the Sok-Oyo seem a bit tough even to me. Aren’t you worried about someone coming in here and strong arming you out of a job?”

“They are welcome to try,” said Sadiya, “a few have. Something I learned early is that though might makes right, ‘might’ is no one thing. Why, take yourself! You have come to me. You are a top spy, a vaunted field commander, and have the resources of the former Imperium at a word. Not a few days ago you stole a few goods, some *quite *valuable it seems, from my team in Koryo. We will come to *that *in a moment, however, what I wish to emphasize is that all this might—and might *it is*—is not enough. Or, how shall I put this, not precisely what all my customers need. What *that* need is for *you* I am *most *curious to learn. 

One example of some ‘might’ you may be seeking is one of my specialties, which are trigger contracts. Let’s say you wanted to shoot me. Now I have three trigger contracts, two of which are quite public—both involve an immediate and substantial dispensation of liquid funds in a stable currency to kill not only the person responsible, but to do ‘irrevocable harm’ to whomever stands to benefit by proxy. These are open contracts, which means payment is delivered upon proof of success. Open contracts can get quite messy! Interpretation of that latter contract is certainly ambiguous, but my executors and I have gone through the nuances thoroughly, so I am confident they would know success when and if they saw it. This, of course, creates a secondary benefit for me in that the cost of my death is something that keeps those who could be *perceived *as my enemies to avoid allowing *consideration *of my assassination. The third contract is secret, a dead-hand switch that only I and my serialized set of executors know about. Maybe it’s to blow this place up! Maybe it’s to release a swarm inside the city limits. No one knows but me. My might, here, comes from money, of course, but also a compilation of secrecy, chaos, and the imagination of my enemies.”

“You see then why I have come to you.”

Sadiya laughed, high and haughty, “Oh delicious. You’ve gotten me to audition. A rare treat! You’re welcome to brag about it to your friends. Now then, to that other business of you embarrassing my mercenaries. I cannot seriously believe you would hire us for Condor after all that. There are only a few options—you’re lying,” she made an exaggerated pout, “the job isn’t worth your time, or, and, I won’t lie, this last one is why I even spoke with you in the first place, you need me to do something you cannot. Oooh,” she savored the thought, “please let it be the last one.”

“You’ll be pleased then, I think. Condor-Moray does have access to military forces, but our *security* is private. And with all the excitement around Violet this year,” Illapa noted the tiniest of winces from Sadiya, “we thought it best to, let’s call it, diversify. We’re looking to secure manufacture and transport of some of our more sensitive chemical components.”

A gamble, a small one, that Vidya had not been overly precise about the nature of the support needed. A further gamble that she was not already compromised and had not shown her hand. No better way to learn about Violet than to buy the same thing.

Sadiya scrutinized her for a moment.

“How marvelous. I was hoping you would answer as such,” she said, standing, “come, let me show you what you’d be purchasing.”

“I have seen your troops in action.”

*Tsk, *she frowned, “No, you’ve seen *a* squad. The Blade of Kahina contracts with thousands of soldiers, with different sub-specialties and roles. What you encountered, furthermore, was what I shall describe as a *unique *situation, but more importantly, and *unrepresentative* one. Come.”

“Where are we going?”

Sadiya laughed, “Why, to see the product of course!”
