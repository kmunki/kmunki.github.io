Luck had long been on the European’s side. You know the type. Bullets with Jack Brand’s name went just wide while his hip shots found their mark’s heart. Nefarious elements with the upper hand gloated just long enough for him to escape and die another day. Whatever random gadgets the old codger of a quartermaster gave him seemed to be *just the thing he needed*. Gracefully sidestepping death was his forte whenever it arrived to take him: be it during the Bangladesh extraction, at the fall of London, and on every other mission for Her Majesty’s Secret Service he had survived since he first earned his license to kill. Famously reserved, the Maharani herself had thanked Brand for his work with that little spot of nastiness with the Chinese. The key, he had found, was to live most fully. The icy focus of fear, the engulfing heat of passion, the flex of one’s muscles and the weightlessness of victory. It wasn’t mere chance, Brand knew, that he had such luck.

He was headed east on the egg-white ship *Hanuman*, a fast and huge catamaran, across the Great Ocean. With less than a week before Uplift, that absurd corporate celebration epitomizing Nubian fetishism of 'innovation' and the garish new wealth of the Rift Valley types, the Keralan Central Intelligence had gotten a lead. A thin one, but enough to send him along. He was to investigate Violet, a massive corporation, and the woman who ran the thing, Xuefang 'Li Xing' Xiao. She was an unassailable genius, but her relentless assault on geopolitical norms was exhausting, like fencing with a tank.

He sat poised, dice in hand, in the ship's elegant casino. The game was Chaupur, an ancient game evolved beyond recognition—only the name and the gods of chance remained: uncaring, unknowing, omnipotent. Orphaned to the state, Brand served the crown, whether the head was British as before or Brahman as now. That was why he was who he was.

“Enough! Roll!” the old Shah, his eyes bugged and white beard jittered with his tense frustration. Brand had caught the plump Persian on a hot streak, bound to cool. Or so Brand thought. They traded wins, the stakes and the stress of riskier and riskier rolls driving fellow gamblers to appreciate their smaller losses. Now it was just the two of them. Under the low light of the ship parlor the jewels of the Shah’s cap danced and flickered like candlelight. He leaned forward. “Your stalling can’t save you, Mr. Brand. I look forward to wearing your watch and spending your purse in celebration at the gala.”

Brand’s ice-blue eyes snapped to the Shah’s before he let them wander to the luxurious Abyssinian heiress at his elbow. She wore a plunging yellow dress with amethysts clinging to her ears like bunches of grapes. The old Persian’s luck seemed impossible. Her beauty, she couldn’t be with him by chance or even choice. How had he forced her hand?

*Wait.*

He raised an eyebrow and stilled his dice hand.

“What now?” the Shah was exasperated, nervously smoothing his moustaches and beard into place. Victory was so near.

“These dice feel cold,” said Brand, “Croupier, anyone can roll for any player, true?”

“Yes, Mr. Brand. A player may request a roll from anyone but myself or another player.”

“Marvelous,” said Brand. He caught the gaze of the heiress.

“Would you do me the honors?” he asked the heiress, “Your Majesty would surely grant a man so condemned as I with one last wish?”

The old Shah laughed, “If you wish her to throw away your money for you, so be it! Even her hands, hot as they are, will not warm your die. Your luck has run out, Mr. Brand.”

“Oh I quite agree,” said Brand, “All the same. Would you?”

The heiress nodded ascent, her long eyelashes lifting to let her eyes lock with Brand’s.

“Lovely!” said Brand, and gestured to the Shah’s dice cup, “would you please?”

“My dice!?” shouted the Shah, his eyes darting.

“There is no prohibition,” the croupier said, stiffening, “A player may use any die, including an opponents.”

“Well there you have it, my dear if you would please?”

The Shah became still as death. The heiress’s earrings swayed and glistened as she grasped the cup in one hand, placing the other over the opening. With a smirk of delight and a giggle of nerves she gave it a gentle shake and launched the dice onto the table.

A roar of excitement and gasps and trills of terror as they bounced off the table edges.

The crowd held its collective breath as only taps and thuds of the die were heard.

The croupier leaned forward, scrutinizing the roll.

“Mr. Brand wins.”

Laughter and applause drowned the furious moan of the Shah, trapped by his own invulnerable luck. No way out for the Shah, no claiming a cheat. *Good show, old boy, *Brand thought to himself, *Britannia's not out of this yet*. The defeated Shah spat and stood from the table, furious.

Brand collected his winnings—the precious gala tickets worth more than the yacht's entire casino bank—and made his way to the bar. That the ESA couldn't score passage for their best agent was galling, but Brand knew the game. Only the best were invited to Violet's private island, and all the best had their vices.

He scoffed, sipping his martini at the bar. That some of the most resource impoverished and far flung pebbles in the middle of the Great Ocean had been bought up in a biotech land grab after the first few post war treaties had always struck him as daft. How anyone could do anything in the doldrums heat of equatorial jungle, a half day’s boat ride from the next anything? Preposterous. Ah well. Nothing left to do but enjoy the rest of the cruise.

Oh, but what’s this? The heiress had sidled up next to him at the bar and slid him a napkin with her room number. Nothing to do but enjoy the cruise, indeed.
