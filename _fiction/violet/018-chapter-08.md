Miriam, luxuriating in the lingering calm and shimmer of the party after her encounter with Brand, was hit with a sudden inspiration. Cells, organelles, and proteins grew and collapsed, folded and unfolded in her mind. The timing and interactions—each somehow resilient enough to keep life going for billions of years and fragile enough that a half-percent perturbation of pH could shut it all down. During the gala watching all those people, those trillions of protein-chains and chemical pathways, she was struck by how all just *worked. *Everyone was *alive.* Not only did it work, but in a chaotic environment, while the gala goers deliberately manipulated the most complex and misunderstood part of themselves, their neural wiring, their *minds* with party drugs and hormones. That’s when it hit her: nature is chaos tolerant; webbed with recoverable pathways. Deep grooves that are hard to leave and easy to find. Almost thwarted by a missing badge, she had set down her drink, come into the quiet lab, thrown on her coat and gotten to work.

Time blurred. Other scientists and lab technicians trickled in, she hardly noticed. 

She was on the verge of a breakthrough. Then, just as components of the new prototype were starting to grow nicely, the lab lights flickered, flared, and went dark. 

She winced, sucking in air through her teeth as if she had pricked her finger mid-surgery. Hushed, startled murmurs from the hallway, the sounds of panic from late-night scientists replaced the hum of equipment and fully broke the spell of her focus. Something was very wrong. There was no glow from the screens. She froze her hands on the controls. The prototype had about seventy-five, maybe ninety seconds without power before it settled and was ruined. Months of work and billions of dollars waited for the back up power to switch on. And lives, thought Miriam, all those lives waiting.

*Don’t move. The APS will be up in a moment. Be ready*, she told herself. The lab was quiet. Breath held, uneven footing of an oddly frozen position, a hand scrabbling for stability. A quiet where you hear your own bones creek trying just to stay still. Her heart pounded in her ears.

Beeps and electric chirps preceded the emergency lights in the corners blinking on and filling the room with a half-glow. Then the specimen lights on her bioprocessor unit flickered on, Miriam's code blinked onto her screen. Her failsafes were well tested, but worst case scenarios had a way of being unpredictable. Things looked to be resuming as expected, she let a sigh of relief escape. *Let’s see how this resilience worked.* She strained into the still dark eyepieces.

The eyepieces rebooted, flickered, and, gods, there it was. A growth had ventured out of a channel. "Organic engineering," her director at her first lab had enjoyed saying whenever an experiment failed, "is the very precise herding of extremely tiny cats." Miriam's hadn't failed, not yet. Seconds remained. She guided the naked-eye-invisible robotic arms to the breach. With one she nudged the sample back on track and with the other, sterilized and sealed the breached path. A slow flow resumed, the barrier held. Readouts on the edges of her HUD were not ideal, but within tolerance.

She leaned back from the eyepieces and exhaled, flipping toggles to freeze the build and letting her hands drop to her sides.

The two huge steel doors of the lab burst open with a crash and a hiss of air. Li Xing rolled tinto the room, her eyes finding Miriam's. Of course Li Xing had guessed she would be here.

"Is it ok? Are you ok?" There was no fear in the urgent voice.

Miriam gave her a serious and unambiguous nod, “Yes. But what the hell happened? Uplift is just weeks away. I’m close. The power failing, Li Xing? You assured me it would be worth it. This borders on self-sabotage.”

Li Xing's eyes blazed, “show me.” She had seen past Miriam’s surface anger to the excitement still effervescing underneath.

As she explained the party-inspired improvements, Miriam felt herself transported to when they were shoulder-to-shoulder, creating the first product to put Violet on the map. Seeing Li Xing catch her excitement was intoxicating. How she had missed this these last few years. Frustrating as it was to admit, Li Xing had been right. Miriam had needed to look away from the problem for just a moment. The distraction of the gala, all that mingling and schmoozing, had let her mind relax long enough to see what all her late nights and mental straining had kept hidden. How fecund that a lack* *of focus can be.

Once more, the lab doors opened. A small, strong woman in black para-military garb with a white prosthetic arm and ink-black eyes strode into the middle of the lab—Hideyo, Violet’s Chief of Security. Seeing Li Xing and Miriam at one of the stations, she paused and relaxed an angstrom. Seconds later two guards followed behind her, each holding the arm of a restrained man in a dirtied, torn tuxedo. He was smiling as the guards half-shoved, half-dragged him into the center of the room.

"Not bad. Quite a laboratory," he said letting his Scottish accent, so often sublimated under British, shine through. “It's amazing what they've got in these all-inclusive island resorts now." The man from the party! Brand! He made eye contact with Miriam and, a bit breathless added, "just everything!" He winked at her and gave a conspiratorial smile.

Li Xing turned her chair and attention to Hideyo, who reported his transgressions, "He attacked a waiter, and a few guards, President Wen. He pushed one, Dakembe, off one of the suspended passages. He survived but he’s hurt badly."

"I see. Thank you, Hideyo,” said Li Xing, "The power outage, also him?” 

The man gave a *you caught me* shrug in response.

"We found this in your office.” She held up a burned out hunk of wires. “Some kind of overload device. We're re-routing and repairing. No major system loss. Everything is back online, APS worked as expected." said Hideyo. She frowned. "He shouldn't have gotten that far though. I'll run through how he got in and add countermeasures. The Keralans aren't as out of date as we hoped."

"No," said the man, "We're not. President Li Xing?" he turned and nodded to her from within the guards' grip, "Jack Brand. We know what you're up to here."

"Brand." Li Xing was grim, yet a glimmer of amusement crept into her voice, "My my, the Agency must find what we do here quite important to send you to our little island. Yes, I know of your name and what you do.”

She rolled her chair toward the man. The guards tightened their grip as she examined him up close. 

"You are a spy." she said. Brand nodded with pride as if it had been a question. Gods, thought Miriam! The European hadn’t been lying. He *was* a shade. Her badge, the little hug—of course.

Li Xing rolled back and said, “Get the transponder, Hideyo.” 

Brand's face dropped. His face twisted with suppressed horror as Hideyo’s synthetic white hand reached into his mouth, grabbed his right rear molar and tore it out. Blood spattered down the front of his tuxedo jacket. Brand hollered in pain and surprise, writhing in the grips of the guards. Hideyo handed the false tooth to Li Xing, her hand flecked crimson. Li Xing held the tooth up, turning it left and right, then put it in her pocket

"You goddamned monster," said Brand, wincing as his tongue grazed the ragged void in his gum. A small trickle of blood ran out the corner of his lips and down his chin. "This isn't how it works. There are rules, there is a way these things—”

Li Xing rolled closer to Brand, the front wheels of her chair bumping his shin. 

“His gun?”

One of the guards placed his Walther PPK into her hand. She granted it momentary study, then flipped the safety and shot him in the thigh. He screamed and wilted, knees buckling to the floor, the guards keeping him upright. Miriam felt a gasp of terror escape her lungs. 

Outside the lab doors, other scientists and staff drawn by the commotion could be seen gathering and peering through the windows, afraid to watch yet unable to look away. At Hideyo’s gesture, Miriam walked over and opened the door and made an inviting gesture. Sheepishly, they came into lab, gathering near the walls or stations, away from the center. Some scientists were grim, braced, but calm. It was easy to spot who had seen remnants of the war, or had its long and dark specter cast over some part of their life. Others were awash with fear. For them the Shadow of the Long War had for them been a mere metaphor, ominous background noise you could almost block out, in an instant becoming real and immediate.

"Let him go," Li Xing ordered. 

The guards released his arms and he collapsed with a moan, clutching his leg and putting pressure on the wound. 

"There was, Mr. Brand. There *was* a way these things were done." Li Xing's face was placid. She aimed at him down the length of her arm, getting a feel for the weapon. She leaned down to Brand who writhed on his side, crumpled in pain. "But the world has moved on. This island, as I am sure you are aware, is part of the Sovereignty of the Violet Corporation. You were at the party! We are a peaceful nation. Like all free nations of the world we do not tolerate espionage—corporate or otherwise.”

Li Xing took two deep, slowing breaths. She set the gun in her lap and pulled the tooth out of her pocket, holding it up to Hideyo. "Activation instructions are in the rest of the file. It's a 3rd or 4th generation, brand new."

"How..." He was pale. Brand's pant leg had soaked through, sitting in an expanding pool of his own blood. Every eye in the lab was on them. Miriam felt herself shaking. Someone wretched. More than a few engineers and scientists, shock wearing off, were fighting tears. Hideyo and both guards had guns drawn and aimed at Brand.

"You're in violation of multiple treaties, Mr. Brand, regardless of what your agency suspects. Which is what, exactly?" Li Xing let a wry tone creep into her voice.

"I'll never tal—“

She rolled her eyes and fired two more rounds into Brand's legs. One round passed through a hand he held up in protest. The second, her aim pulled a bit by the recoil, tore off the end of his foot. His screams redoubled, his eyes wide with horror, surrounded by the blood that had spattered on his face.

“Hideyo, how embarrassing. You were right," said Li Xing over Brand's cries of agony, leaning forward in her chair to assess the accuracy of her shots, "you really do need to squeeze with the whole hand. Easier than I thought to pull to one side. 

“And, yes, I suppose you won't talk." Li Xing said, returning her attention to Brand. "As CEO and President of the nation of Violet, I pronounce you guilty of espionage and conspiracy to commit economic sabotage. I further charge you with reckless endangerment of civilians and terrorism. Did you cause that power outage, Mr. Brand?"

He shouted a stammering, "Yes" broken by sobs. He was curled in on himself, shaking.

"Your confession is noted as such. Guilty." She fired two rounds into his chest. Several engineers screamed. He flew back star-fished onto the floor. Ragged gurgling breaths shuttered through him. The terror in his eyes was gone, only disbelief remained. He moved as if to check his watch a final time.

"No, Mr. Brand." She put a round through his head. And then another. "Your gadgets will not save you today." She fired again into his head and chest, put the safety back on, and handed the gun to a guard. "Dispose of that, please." Quieter, to Hideyo she continued, "Send him deep, make sure the transponder is with him. Water depth will set it off.”

Hideyo nodded, said "President Wen” in acknowledgement and left. The guards hefted the corpse of Jack Brand by his ankles and shoulders, leaving a widening pool of smeared blood on the lab’s entryway floor.

Li Xing turned to Miriam and her team. Various degrees of horror registered on every face, even Miriam's. Damnit, thought Li Xing.  Expenditure of authority, of power and force, always had a cost.

"I'm sorry you had to witness that," she let her eyes move across the faces the scientists and engineers, her voice soft, vulnerable. "That man," she gestured with a partial head turn, holding her face just to the side, "That man and the people he represents wanted to hurt you." Her voice quavered, unsteady, "To hurt you, my people. You, my team. He wanted to put your lives in danger because he did not understand what you were building. He represents those who seek to guard their pocketbooks and pensions under the guise of public safety and the common good." She spat the words. She lifted her chin and looking at each of them as she spoke, her tone elevated and clear. "You know what we are building here is a better world. You knew we would be misunderstood. I am sorry that I let him get this far. My job, my *only* job here is to get problems out of your way, so you can create tomorrow."

A few met her gaze. Many looked at the floor, shoulders drawn up.

"It would appear the party is very much over. That's enough for tonight,” said Li Xing, definitive. "Thank you all for being here late. But we need to secure the labs and, more than that, you all have just seen something I promised wouldn’t happen in this new world we’re building. Stop whatever it is as soon as you safely can, then leave. You're not to work. Miriam," Li Xing said, turning to her Chief Engineer, "see that everyone is out of this lab in fifteen minutes."

Miriam straightened up and said "It'll be dark and quiet when you check back in ten, President Wen.” She could not entirely eliminate the quaver in her voice.

A corner of Li Xing's mouth let a half-smile escape.

Later Li Xing passed the doors of the lab, the observation windows showing the dull blue-gray light of the empty, shut down lab. Li Xing smiled, Miriam never failed.

Her thoughts returned to the dead agent. She seethed. 

The Shah gambles away a ticket and someone steals from her rotting *office*. Miriam’s badge lifted during the gala. Picked locks. The plan. The *List*. Hideyo had fumbled in a way she hadn’t expected. Perhaps the party itself was a mistake—hubris.

No. It had been the right play.

Powerful countries act like powerful countries. Soft power. Diplomacy. The art of signaling one’s place was strategic, much more delightful than pushing around black and white pebbles. Reading the nuance of bows, the hierarchy of who sat where and spoke with whom; which jokes got polite chuckles and gentle arm touches, “Oh how marvelous, your excellency. May I speak with you for a moment?” Why muster an army when a sentence could disarm the enemy? Bending ears and eyes and purses and vaults was always more delightful than bombing and kidnapping. Terror had its place—what a lever it was with the right fulcrum—but it could be brittle. His death was necessary. Power in front of her people, sovereign authority. 

Those Keralans besotted with their conquered continent knew how to pray upon your last shreds of dignity, didn’t they? Brand was washed up. The ESA a mess. It was a zero risk tactic for the UKK’s Intelligence Ministry to send him, but what did they want? The Samraat was a major stakeholder in Violet. If the Keralan crown was so intent on finding out what her little upstart was doing, perhaps filling the empty seat held for her royal grace at every board meeting would have been a better way to start.

She had some sympathy: the Indians had bad luck with tiny islands dreaming of world domination. The Europeans would be angry as well, of course, another blow to their shriveling reputation, their position within the UKK further diminished.

How to adjust? How to leverage this? Crisis and threat, find the win. Defense would be easier to explain now. Investments could be articulated to the board. R & D had always been corporate only. Time to be a country. Not quite military. Just M.A.D. capable. New nation, no treaties yet —not even a day old and already a diplomatic incident. 

*Frustrating*.

Ripple effects and consequences. Who would come next? Not the Rift Valley. The Inka? Perhaps, though Condor was a known threat. The Sok-Oyo? A risk… but they could be bought, and would keep Violet’s hands clean. Direct action would require transgressing one of the dozens of tangled global treaties that kept the peace for a near century. One got the impression they made war too much paperwork to be worth it. One mistake, though, and we’re back to attempting to annihilate humanity just to catch our enemies in the collateral damage, living out of arcologies. 

But Brand’s plan had entirely backfired. The Keralans were out in the open, exposed while her secrets stayed safe. Moreover, this was nearly an international incident that, with the right leaks and insinuations she could turn eyes away from Violet’s debut, toward the old guard nibbling away at the boundaries of the peace. She must move first. *She* is who would come next. With the spotlight on them, it was all that much easier for her to move in the shadows.

Which meant it could all finally, in earnest, *begin*.
