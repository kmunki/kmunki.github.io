Out at the edge of the Grand Palace were shrines. Most were small, uninteresting affairs. A few had enclosures of old warped wood. Hye walked among them and the surrounding trees and ponds. Within one there were two jade figures, a tiger and a bear, flanking a platter. The tiger was carved pacing, unable to sit still. Its eyes were on the viewer and the exit to the shrine. Conversely, the bear sat, contemplative, observing the center of the offering plate, as peaceful as the buddha. Where there should have been clawed forepaws, the bear had human hands, delicate and thin, as though emerging from a heavy fur jacket.

Hye picked up a punk of incense and, setting it upright in the sand, lit it. On a piece of paper, she had written, in her best calligraphy, *Sifu*. She set it on the metal tray and lit it. The flash paper caught instantly and, in a burst, was gone. Smoke curled in ribbons off the incense.

“Ah,” came a voice behind her, “I thought I might find you here.”

“Viceroy Daewoo,” said Hye in acknowledgement and greeting, her eyes still fixed on the incense.

The former Vizier approached, artificial legs tapping the old wood, and knelt beside her fellow Ward. As ever, her robes were the most ornate and traditional still worn for her office.

“You’re doing us Wards proud, Viceroy.”

Daewoo chuckled softly, leaning a shoulder into Hye’s.

“I could say the same for you. Friend to Arc Chiefs, survivor of the Wilds, winner of the Crane-Dragon Duel. Koryo is honored to call you our own. You’ve nothing left to prove, Hyeon. Stay. I need a good Vizier.”

“She’s still out there,” said Hye, “Violet still has Sun. I cannot abandon her.”

“Any word from the Inkan spy? The Sapa have been reticent.”

“No. Just more questions: why she took the Sifu’s body; who and what are the Lost and Lucky Children; what is the society; where is Sun?”

“Are the answers out there? You’re so sure?”

“I wish I was sure of anything. I don’t even know where to start.”

“I think I can help with that.”

Hye turned, quizzical.

Daewoo reached into her robes and removed an octagonal cylinder of beautifully carved sandalwood. She removed its cap, revealing within a bundle of sticks, each ending in a hexagram.

“The Yi Ching?”

Daewoo smiled, and nodded. She held the open cylinder out, wafting the stick ends through the incense.

“Hold the question in your mind,” she said.

Hye drew in a breath and focused, eyes closed.

Viceroy Daewoo began to shake the box, just so. The red sandalwood of the box and sticks glistened in the combined light of the candles and the stray sun through the grated windows. Soon the gentle shaking produced a single stick, protruding among the rest. Daewoo withdrew it, her finger and thumb covering the hexagram thereupon inscribed, and offered it to Hye.

Hye grasped it between pressed palms, pressed the edges of her hands to her forehead and bowed. Rising, she looked at her fortune.

She smiled, almost laughing.

“Lucky me.”
