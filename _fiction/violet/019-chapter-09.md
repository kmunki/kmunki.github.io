No one liked the plan. But neither Jee nor Advika felt like facing the Viceroy’s inevitable grilling about why their inspection hadn’t caught a critical gap in resource supply or, if it had, why they did nothing to address it. 

The military-issue motos roared across the steppe. A herd of wild ponies, scarred and beautiful, galloped away, aware of what was coming. They had adapted to edge-land harshness—no species could survive out here otherwise. A phalanx of buggies, some of the few vehicles the Olgoi kept as its own, bounced and rumbled behind the motos. Advika had gone out ahead, her moto now a black dot obscured in dust. 

When they arrived, her expression was dour. The transport was not late, it was stuck. Barrels of reactant had come loose and lay strewn about next to the big rig itself, which was half tilted over, an axel shattered and two rear wheels blown out. The crew, just three arcies, were covered in grease and filth, their hands bloody with effort.

“This is sabotage,” she said as they removed their helmets, “Rigs like this are built to handle open terrain, no road, not even this pockmarked suggestion of a goat trail could have done that. And look here,” the old woman bent low and tapped the split axel, “should be rent, all torn up. That’s a clean cut. Pre-weakened.”

“Load up the barrels,” Bolormaa bellowed, “we save what we can.”

They worked fast, strapping barrels onto every available surface of the buggies. The sky darkened on the horizon. Oh gods, thought Hye, there it was: a cloud of all-consuming fury. Each swarm was unique, she knew, a product of the war, roaming the wilds attempting to satiate urges bred into them almost a century ago. Though generations of individuals had come and gone, the swarm remained, designed to self-sustain, replace, and to adapt. Only a few instincts drove them—consume, replicate, preserve the swarm, kill and destroy anything else.

“That’s it!” Shouted the General, “it’s visible, we have to go *now*.”

The buggies lurched forward, their knobby springs and frames complaining of their extra baggage and passengers. Hye steadied her moto, two barrels draped like saddle bags over the back. Wobbly at the start, once under way she was able to hold it steady. Advika, the General, and Sun’s motos were alongside. Speed was a problem, they simply could not go as fast without risking dislodging the cargo. They abandoned the transport with the futile hope some of it might go unmolested, knowing there would be little left to find.

The Olgoi once again rose from the steppe ahead of them, the swarm now nearly filling a third of the sky, a black, shimmering cloud. Scorwevs, as Hye had guessed. The word had been translated so many times it was hard to know what it meant, if anything. Insect in body plan, they borrowed features from a healthy swath of the exoskeletal world. Burrow, sting, tear, stun, inject, replicate. Anything organic became food. Everything else was shredded. Scorwevs were an army ready-made for scorched-earth warfare, now loose after their creators were too weakened to issue anything resembling a stand down order. The surface of the Olgoi moved; something was opening beneath the sod. From the arcology, streaks of rocket fire blazed across the sky towards the cloud. The blasts lit up her vision off to the right. After a few second’s delay, *boom, boom, boom, *light and sound out of sync. The angry, beetling cloud tightened and condensed, chunks of it falling from the sky, bodies never having a chance to hit the ground as their brethren shredded and consumed the charred dead mid-flight.

Gods the sound. The demonic drone of fifty-thousand wings—louder than the wind roar and tire rumble as they raced for the safety.

Advika and the General set a dangerous, essential pace. The line stretched out, with two of the buggies able to keep up with the lead and one, falling back, flanked by the less confident Hye and Sun. 

Hye could feel the moto struggling, the shocks groaned with every boulder and her own arms burning with the effort to keep it steady. In front of her, the laggard buggy shuttered hard and was, in an instant, a cloud of dust. Hye shot past. The front tire had blown, now just dragging a rim. Hye looked at the swarm, then to the buggy. She waved Sun on and slammed on the breaks, nearly rolling the moto in the effort to turn around. She roared back to the buggy and pulled along side.

She flipped up her face shield, “Come on! Get on!” She screamed over the monstrous din. More explosions pounded above them. The buggy driver had eyes only for the barrels. She pointed at the swarm. The boy—he was only a boy, she saw now—froze, his eyes wide. She clambered off her bike and dragged him out of the buggy. Get on, she bellowed as she strained to right the moto. Get on! He swung a leg over and held onto her. Hye cranked the accelerator and they rolled forward with horrible slowness. Too much weight, too much momentum, they would die on the steppe together, grub food.

She steadied the moto as it rumbled over the open grass, turned back onto the road and pushed the throttles to maximum. The moto’s engines strained as it built speed across the steppe, the boy clinging to her in terror. A blinding red beam swept above them, a defense laser raking across the swarm, the whine of chain guns and the thunder of the last rockets booming in sync with their explosions. 

The swarm was here. They weren’t going to make it.

The barrels! She reached back to flip the latch to unclasp the barrels. The boy grabbed her hand. Hye, startled, jerking the handle bars and nearly dumped them over, but whipped her hand back into place just in time. 

“No!” The boy shouted, “Please!” His voice was desperate. He knew who would lose between the incubators and Koryo quotas.

“We are going to die!”

“I can’t face them!”

Among the overwhelming noise of crackling of carapaces and detonations a new sound—another engine.

Somehow Sifu Advika Shidao was there on her jet black moto. She pulled along side, the two motos all but touching.

“You aren’t going to make it! Jump! Jump!” She screamed at the boy.

“Jump!” Hye commanded.

He did, clumsy with fear. But he was too high, grabbing Advika’s shoulders instead of her waist, his momentum too much even for the seasoned old Sifu.

“Go!” Advika demanded as the bike tilted and fell. Hye looked back to see as the shadow passed over them.

Hye screamed in horror as she rocketed away. 

Sifu. No. 

She could see the loading bay door. It was closing. She had to make it. She would make it. She would not fail Sifu, her sacrifice would not be wasted. She reached back and flipped the clasp, the barrels rending and tumbling. Unburdened, the moto launched forward. From inside the loading bay Hye could see belches of flame from the internal defenses.

Crack! Something hit her helmet hard from behind, nearly sending her over the handle bars. She unclasped the chin strap and threw the helmet loose. She did not look back. Small arms fire all around, picking off the swarm’s first wave as it began to land, latching onto the thick hide of the Olgoi. 

She roared through the slow closing doors and skidded to a halt.

“Where is Sifu!?” Sun wailed over the cacophony, helping her sister off the moto.

They turned and saw a far off speck through the narrowing gap in the doors.

“The walls must hold,” Bolormaa was sobbing, both hands holding down a lever, “The Olgoi had not fallen in eighty three years it will not fall today.” She was talking to herself.

“No!” Yelled Hye, “they can make it!”

Hye and Sun ran over and fought Bolormaa, yanking the lever to neutral. The huge doors for a moment halted. Scorwevs were crawling and flying in, too many for the auto-cannons and small arms fire. The other transport drivers ran over, themselves crying, and pulled Hye and Sun off Bolormaa, who pushed the lever down once again. The doors lurched back into motion. 

It was enough. 

The jet black bike flew through the gap, just nicking each side. Advika sent the bike into a slide to keep from pancaking them on the far side of the wall. The doors closed with a boom, dozens of scorewevs crushed between them. In an instant the roar of the swarm outside was all but inaudible. The few that made their way inside were easy targets. Wails of anguish and relief came from Bolormaa. She half stumbled half ran, pulling the boy off the moto, ignoring his groans of agony and embracing him. Hye could hear her uttering something through her sobs in Mongolian, the same phrases repeated over and over.

As Bolormaa held the boy Sun and Hye helped Advika up. Her left leg was mangled and left elbow broken. A divot the size of a lemon had been taken out of her right side, scorwev bite. Bolormaa looked up at the battered old woman with awe then buried her face in the boy’s shoulder, now weeping yet still speaking the repeating words.

“That was a terrible idea,” said the Sifu to her students, “Hye you made me scratch my moto.”

“We lost several barrels,” said the General, “and nearly the whole arc itself in the process. The Viceroy will not be pleased.”

“But we didn’t lose all the barrels, or the arc,” said Hye as she and Sun each slid a shoulder under the old Sifu’s arms and began to help her toward the arcology’s interior door.

“What is she saying,” the General asked, noting Bolormaa’s extreme reaction.

“My boy my boy,” Advika said, “thank you my boy you saved my boy.”

With the great doors shut and the commotion of treating the injured attended too, the Olgoi could almost be mistaken for peaceful. Sun and the General resumed the tour while Hye sat with Advika in the infirmary. The old Sifu’s age was apparent and, in this state—her leg wrapped in a chrys-cast and scale-skin bandages plastered on her arms and side—she looked almost fragile.

“You do not need to watch over me,” Advika said, her eyes half-lidded with sedative “though appreciated, I won’t heal any faster with you here.”

“You will,” said Hye, “because as soon as I leave you will grab your staff and begin hobbling about, stretching the bandages and burning up the calories the infusions need to accelerate your healing. Then you’ll faint—“

“I would not faint!” Advika protested.

“It is good,” said Bolormaa, who neither had noticed was standing at the doorway, “to be weak at times.”

The Arc Chief looked depleted. She came into the room and sat in a chair facing both Hye and Advika. 

“Children at Olgoi,” she began, “are raised in clutches. Most arcs are same. Raised together—by older clutches and a few rearers who raise many, many clutches their whole life .”

“We have rearers in the Joseon Koryo as well, Arc Chief,” said Hye, “all of the Continuum, really. Sun and I have Sifu, a gift from our Generation Mother, Viceroy Jeoson Mi-Yong, who the Sifu—“

“Owed a favor. Why she spent it on asking a war-relic to tutor a Princess and Ward, she never explained.” Advika paused, catching her breath, “but I don’t think you came in here to discuss the nuances of reproductive strategy?”

“No, no,” Bolormaa said, with a sad smile, “I have point, promise. Olgoi are like most born post-war. No *parents*. Boy was one day wandering around arc. We encourage this, to learn arc ways and workings. I turned a corner and boom! He bumped into the Arc Chief!” She slapped her thighs in emphasis. “Not watching where he was going. I almost scold him, but then instead, say, ‘Follow me.’ 

Then I ignore him. Whole day, he follow, quiet as a scut. Next morning, he at my door. Again he watch and follow. This all years ago. We become,” she became quiet, thoughtful. “Bond,” she said, “we bond.

He get older, late teens, comfortable outside. Good outside. Good outside! Ha!” She laughed at hearing herself say the two words in that order, and continued, “soon he helping with transports.”

“The whole time,” Hye interjected, “you must have known. That he was out there, that he was late and a swarm on the way.” 

The Arc Chief nodded, the worry that had been gnawing at her flashing across her face. 

“Yes, I knew. I worry. When the swarm close and he not through doors, worry is now fear.” She presses the palm of her fist against her chest,”Arc Chiefs, though, must mother all, not just some. Worry. Fear. Not for just boy. For all Olgoi. Can not risk swarm getting inside. 

Closing the doors,” she said as tears welled again in her eyes, “require strength,” she looks up at them, eyes reddened. “Was like he already dead, closing doors like putting his body in digester.”

She took a large, shuddering breath.

“When the Sifu brought him back, it was not from the outside in,” the Arc Chief looked Advika in the eyes, “but from death to life. And you,” Bolormaa turned to look at Hye, putting hand on hers, “he tell me you get him out of buggy, out of frozen fear. That is why I say ‘thank you for my boy.’ Not my boy, but my boy. You return him to me. Need more than thank you, so I tell story, so you understand thank you.”

She looked them each in the eye and said, “Thank you. Thank you for my boy.”
