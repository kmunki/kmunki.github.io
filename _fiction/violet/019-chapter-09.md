No one liked the plan. But neither General Jee nor Advika felt like facing the Viceroy's inevitable grilling about why their inspection hadn't caught a critical gap in resource supply or, if it had, why they did nothing to address it. 

The military-issue motos roared across the steppe. A herd of wild ponies, scarred and beautiful, galloped away, aware of what was coming. They had adapted to edge-land harshness—no species could survive out here otherwise. A phalanx of buggies, some of the few vehicles the Olgoi kept as its own, bounced and rumbled behind the motos. Advika had gone out ahead, her moto now a black dot obscured in dust. 

When they arrived, her expression was dour. The transport was not late, it was stuck. Barrels of reactant had come loose and lay strewn about next to the big rig itself, which was half tilted over, an axel shattered and two rear wheels blown out. The crew, just three arcies, were covered in grease and filth, their hands bloody with effort.

"This is sabotage," she said as they removed their helmets, "Rigs like this are built to handle open terrain, no road, not even this pockmarked suggestion of a goat trail could have done that. And look here," the old woman bent low and tapped the split axel, her fingers tracing the clean edge. "Should be rent, all torn up. This isn't damage—someone *did* this. Deliberately. Someone *knew* this transport would pass here today. Knew the timing. Knew the route. Knew when the swarm would be moving."

General Jee's jaw tightened. She met Advika's eyes for a long moment—the recognition of a trap, deliberate and targeted, the work of someone with intelligence networks and precision—then turned away. The silence between them held weight: this wasn't chance or negligence. This was strategy.

Hye understood what that exchange meant: this was sabotage. Someone with intelligence and access had planned this. But there was no time to think about who or why. *Just yet*, a voice in her head warned, *someone will answer for this.*

"Load up the barrels," Bolormaa bellowed, "we save what we can."

They worked fast, strapping barrels onto every available surface of the buggies. The sky darkened on the horizon. And there it was, visible now, rising like a dark god: a cloud of all-consuming fury. A product of the war—designed to consume, replicate, preserve itself, destroy anything else. Each swarm was unique, but all driven by the same ancient urge: satiate the hunger bred into them a century ago. Though generations of individuals had come and gone, the swarm remained, self-sustaining, self-replicating. Unstoppable.

“That’s it!” Shouted the General, “it’s visible, we have to go *now*.”

The buggies lurched forward, their knobby springs and frames complaining of their extra baggage and passengers. Hye steadied her moto, two barrels draped like saddle bags over the back. Wobbly at the start, once under way she was able to hold it steady. Advika, the General, and Sun’s motos were alongside. Speed was a problem, they simply could not go as fast without risking dislodging the cargo. They abandoned the transport with the futile hope some of it might go unmolested, knowing there would be little left to find.

The Olgoi once again rose from the steppe ahead of them, the swarm now nearly filling a third of the sky, a black, shimmering cloud—thousands of individual creatures moving in coordinated hunger. Scorwevs, as Hye had guessed. The word had been translated so many times it was hard to know what it meant, if anything. Insect in body plan, they borrowed features from a healthy swath of the exoskeletal world. Burrow, sting, tear, stun, inject, replicate. Anything organic became food. Everything else was shredded. Scorwevs were an army ready-made for scorched-earth warfare, now loose after their creators were too weakened to issue anything resembling a stand down order. The surface of the Olgoi moved; something was opening beneath the sod. From the arcology, streaks of rocket fire blazed across the sky towards the cloud. The blasts lit up her vision off to the right. After a few second's delay, *boom, boom, boom, *light and sound out of sync. The angry, beetling cloud tightened and condensed, chunks of it—bodies, individual creatures—falling from the sky, each shredded by its brethren even before impact.

Gods the sound. The demonic drone of fifty-thousand wings—louder than the wind roar and tire rumble as they raced toward safety.

Advika and the General set a dangerous, essential pace. The line stretched out, with two of the buggies able to keep up with the lead and one, falling back, flanked by the less confident Hye and Sun. 

Hye could feel the moto struggling, the shocks groaning with every boulder, her own arms burning with the effort to keep it steady. In front of her, the laggard buggy shattered hard and became a cloud of dust in an instant. Hye shot past it. The front tire had blown, now dragging just rim on stone. Hye looked at the swarm. Then at the buggy. She waved Sun on and slammed on the brakes, nearly rolling the moto in the effort to turn around. She roared back to the buggy and pulled along side.

She flipped up her face shield, “Come on! Get on!” She screamed over the monstrous din. More explosions pounded above them. The buggy driver had eyes only for the barrels. She pointed at the swarm. The boy—he was only a boy, she saw now—froze, his eyes wide. She clambered off her bike and dragged him out of the buggy. Get on, she bellowed as she strained to right the moto. Get on! He swung a leg over and held onto her, trembling. *Sun had never trembled like this*, she thought as she cranked the accelerator. They rolled forward with horrible slowness. Too much weight, too much momentum, they would die on the steppe together, grub food.

She steadied the moto as it rumbled over the open grass, turned back onto the road and pushed the throttles to maximum. The moto’s engines strained as it built speed across the steppe, the boy clinging to her in terror. A blinding red beam swept above them, a defense laser raking across the swarm, the whine of chain guns and the thunder of the last rockets booming in sync with their explosions. 

The swarm was here. They weren't going to make it.

The barrels. *Gone.* Hye made a choice the boy couldn't—she twisted, reached back, flipped the latch. The clasp gave. The barrels rended and tumbled away, instantly swallowed by the swarm's roar.

The boy grabbed her hand. Hye, startled, jerking the handle bars and nearly dumped them over, but whipped her hand back into place just in time. 

"No!" The boy shouted, "Please! No, no—" His voice was desperate, and Hye understood in that panic: he wasn't afraid of death. He was afraid of *failure*. He knew who would lose between the incubators and Koryo quotas. *Like Sun knew*. Orphans born into arc supply chains. Children. The breeding program's numbers.

“We are going to die!”

“I can’t face them!”

Among the overwhelming noise of crackling of carapaces and detonations a new sound—another engine.

Somehow Sifu Advika Shidao was there on her jet black moto. She pulled along side, the two motos all but touching.

“You aren’t going to make it! Jump! Jump!” She screamed at the boy.

“Jump!” Hye commanded.

He did, clumsy with fear. But he was too high, grabbing Advika's shoulders instead of her waist, his momentum too much—and yet the Sifu's arm locked. In that fraction of a second, Hye saw something that shouldn't have been possible: Advika bracing herself with strength that held. For a moment. Just a moment.

“Go!” Advika demanded as the bike tilted and fell. Hye looked back to see as the shadow passed over them.

Hye screamed in horror as she rocketed away. 

Sifu. No. 

She could see the loading bay door. It was closing. She had to make it. She would make it. She would not fail Sifu, her sacrifice would not be wasted. She reached back and flipped the clasp, the barrels rending and tumbling. Unburdened, the moto launched forward. From inside the loading bay Hye could see belches of flame from the internal defenses.

Crack! Something hit her helmet hard from behind, nearly sending her over the handle bars. She unclasped the chin strap and threw the helmet loose. She did not look back. Small arms fire all around, picking off the swarm’s first wave as it began to land, latching onto the thick hide of the Olgoi. 

She roared through the slow closing doors and skidded to a halt.

“Where is Sifu!?” Sun wailed over the cacophony, helping her sister off the moto.

They turned and saw a far off speck through the narrowing gap in the doors.

“The walls must hold,” Bolormaa was sobbing, both hands holding down a lever, “The Olgoi had not fallen in eighty three years it will not fall today.” She was talking to herself.

“No!” Yelled Hye, “they can make it!”

Hye and Sun ran over and fought Bolormaa, yanking the lever to neutral. The huge doors for a moment halted. Scorwevs were crawling and flying in, too many for the auto-cannons and small arms fire. The other transport drivers ran over, themselves crying, and pulled Hye and Sun off Bolormaa, who pushed the lever down once again. The doors lurched back into motion. 

It was enough. 

The jet black bike flew through the gap, just nicking each side. Advika sent the bike into a slide to keep from pancaking them on the far side of the wall. The doors closed with a boom, dozens of scorewevs crushed between them. In an instant the roar of the swarm outside was all but inaudible.

General Jee appeared beside Advika as she dismounted, gripping her shoulder for a moment—no words, just the pressure of recognition between soldiers who had just moved together as one organism. The look they exchanged said what decades of shared danger can: *you came back. You always do*.

The few that made their way inside were easy targets. Wails of anguish and relief came from Bolormaa. She half stumbled half ran, pulling the boy off the moto, ignoring his groans of agony and embracing him. Hye could hear her uttering something through her sobs in Mongolian, the same phrases repeated over and over.

As Bolormaa held the boy Sun and Hye helped Advika up. Her left leg was mangled and left elbow broken. A divot the size of a lemon had been taken out of her right side, scorwev bite. Bolormaa looked up at the battered old woman with awe then buried her face in the boy’s shoulder, now weeping yet still speaking the repeating words.

“That was a terrible idea,” said the Sifu to her students, “Hye you made me scratch my moto.”

“We lost several barrels,” said the General, “and nearly the whole arc itself in the process. The Viceroy will not be pleased.”

“But we didn’t lose all the barrels, or the arc,” said Hye as she and Sun each slid a shoulder under the old Sifu’s arms and began to help her toward the arcology’s interior door.

“What is she saying,” the General asked, noting Bolormaa’s extreme reaction.

“My boy my boy,” Advika said, “thank you my boy you saved my boy.”

With the great doors shut and the commotion of treating the injured attended too, the Olgoi could almost be mistaken for peaceful. Sun and the General resumed the tour while Hye sat with Advika in the infirmary. The old Sifu's age was apparent and, in this state—her leg wrapped in a chrys-cast and scale-skin bandages plastered on her arms and side, her breathing shallow and deliberate—she looked almost fragile.

"You do not need to watch over me," Advika said, her eyes half-lidded with sedative "though appreciated, I won't heal any faster with you here."

"You will," said Hye simply. "Because you need someone to keep you from your staff."

"I would not faint!" Advika protested.

"The chrys-cast will hold the leg," came a new voice from the doorway. One of the arc's medical technicians, a woman with grey-streaked hair and competent bearing, stepped into the room. "Four weeks, maybe five, and the Sifu will be mobile. The elbow and side damage—the bite especially—that will take longer. Eight weeks before she's fully healed." She paused, and the next words came carefully. "The venom is dormant now, but scorwev bites have a way of... lingering. The site will scar badly. Strength in that arm may never fully return." She looked at Advika. "And you will fight me every day on the restrictions."

Advika smiled thinly. "Eight weeks is acceptable."

"It is good," said Bolormaa, who neither had noticed was standing at the doorway, "to be weak at times."

The Arc Chief looked depleted. She came into the room and sat in a chair facing both Hye and Advika. 

"Children at the Olgoi," she began, "are raised in clutches. Most arcs are the same. Raised together—by older clutches and a few rearers who raise many clutches their whole life."

"We have rearers in the Joseon Koryo as well, Arc Chief," said Hye, "all of the Continuum, really. Sun and I have Sifu, a gift from our Generation Mother, Viceroy Yi In-yeong, who the Sifu—"

“Owed a favor. Why she spent it on asking a war-relic to tutor a Princess and Ward, she never explained.” Advika paused, catching her breath, “but I don’t think you came in here to discuss the nuances of reproductive strategy?”

"No, no," Bolormaa said, with a sad smile, "I have a point, I promise. Olgoi are like most born post-war. No *parents*. The boy was one day wandering the arc. We encourage this, to learn arc ways and workings. I turned a corner and boom! He bumped into the Arc Chief!” She slapped her thighs in emphasis. “Not watching where he was going. I almost scold him, but then instead, say, ‘Follow me.’ 

Then I ignore him. Whole day, he follow, quiet as a scut. Next morning, he at my door. Again he watch and follow. This all years ago. We become,” she became quiet, thoughtful. “Bond,” she said, “we bond.

He get older, late teens, comfortable outside. Good outside. Good outside! Ha!” She laughed at hearing herself say the two words in that order, and continued, “soon he helping with transports.”

“The whole time,” Hye interjected, “you must have known. That he was out there, that he was late and a swarm on the way.” 

The Arc Chief nodded, the worry that had been gnawing at her flashing across her face. 

"Yes, I knew. I worry. When the swarm came close and he was not through the doors, worry became fear." She pressed the palm of her fist against her chest. "Arc Chiefs, though, must mother all, not just some. Worry. Fear. Not for just the boy. For all the Olgoi. I cannot risk the swarm getting inside. 

Closing the doors,” she said as tears welled again in her eyes, “require strength,” she looks up at them, eyes reddened. “Was like he already dead, closing doors like putting his body in digester.”

She took a large, shuddering breath.

"When the Sifu brought him back, it was not from the outside in," the Arc Chief looked Advika in the eyes, "she brought him from death itself—from the jaws of that swarm, from my failure in closing those doors, from the grip of frozen fear—into life. And you," Bolormaa turned to look at Hye, putting hand on hers, "he tell me you get him out of buggy first, out of that frozen fear that nearly killed him. That is why I say 'thank you for my boy.' Not my boy, but my boy. You return him to me. Need more than thank you, so I tell story, so you understand thank you."

She looked them each in the eye and said, “Thank you. Thank you for my boy.”
