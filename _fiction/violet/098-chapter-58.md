“Crane-Dragon Duel for the Throne of Koryo.” She bowed to the Prince, then the Ward, then the judges. “Are our Judges ready?” The three masters nodded. “Ward?” Hye snapped her arms and fists rigid. “Prince?”

“You will remember my title*, *Vizier, when you are begging for your life.”

“Ready?” Daewoo repeated, placid.

“I, the future Viceroy, am ready.”

“Challengers are ready!” Daewoo yells, “Let Crane-Dragon Duel for the Throne of Koryo and rule of the New Joseon Dynasty commence!”

“When I’m victorious,” Jiwoo hissed, “I’ll ban this absurd tradition.”

Lightning crashed, framing the moment in lurid white. Wind from the in-rolling storm pulled like destiny at the circling fighters. The crowd watched in hushed awe, Ji-woo silhouetted against the sunset and Hye lit blazing red. Shadow and blood.

“You know,” Jiwoo offered to Hye, “when you lose, I can try you for treason?”

Pain lanced through Hye’s muscles. Fatigue—physical and emotional—sapped her strength.

“The only question. Which of us,” Daewoo yelled, “most deserves to rule?”

Jiwoo lunged, his strike a feint for a kick. Obvious, telegraphed. 

“Hai!” Bellowed Ji-woo. “I do!

How could he be so clumsy? It had to be an act, a trap. 

“First response, Prince Jiwoo!”

“The decision is made!” He roared, furious. “When Koryo was in need, who was here? Who did the council Select, but me? Why did—”

Ji-woo stumbled as Hye probed, cautious, fists and feet darting, like the striking beak of the duel’s namesake. Jiwoo’s blocks were childish, unpracticed, sloppy. The speed was there—but no form, no finesse.

“Who deserves to rule!?” He repeated, rhetorical and furious, batting away Hye’s strikes. “I am Yi Ji-woo, the man born for the moment, with the lineage of every Queen and Viceroy before. I am Progeny, Prince of the New Joseon, a treasure trained to lead. My strength is *your *strength, councilors. That of a true roy—”

The ball of Hye’s foot, drawn back and launched in the span of a syllable, found the prince’s solar plexus as unguarded and soft as his logic. She felt his diaphragm spasm as he buckled, his confidence lost along with his breath as he buckled to the ground.

He curled into a ball, wheezing, desperate to get air back into his lungs. His own gasps drowning out the stunned whispers of the assembled councilors and ambassadors. Groans, fed by shame and indignation, rose to wails of impotent fury.

“Judgement!” Daewoo shouted.

“I, well,” the councilor of verse was beside herself, “this is an incomplete answer. What was presented was… weak. It was plain. Rhetoric?”

“I concur,” said the old man, “middling efficacy. Bloviation. Inauspicious beginning.”

“Bathetic,” said the master of form.

“Response,” said Hye, standing over the prince.

“Response, Ward Hyeon!” 

She turned her back on Ji-woo to face the crowd. Behind her, the oncoming storm.

“Blade and shadow, wilds and wendigo, I have survived. Village born, palace bred, arcology hard. Imagine a nation as indomitable as I…”

 As she looked for sympathy among the crowd, eyes darted away. The judges were as statues, unmoved. Daewoo herself seemed uncomfortable, as though the display were beneath both, this sad scrabbling of power. Ji-woo had not won them, but Hye was losing them. She searched the crowd, found no friends of a Ward as ruler.

“Hai,” said Jiwoo rising. “Not so arrogant now, are you Ward?” A flicker in his hand—a sudden tense as it pressed into his thigh as he stood—a stim. She watched his body stiffen and flex. “I was not finished. Your foreigner tricks from that mutant who broke the world don’t fool these wise people. You claim a puppeteer that none have seen. All know *your *manipulator. A Zhongguo witch, an alien with no loyalty and no honor.”

His strikes came fast now. Brutal and swift, chaotic. Hye retreated, but not fast enough, her muscles burning and spasming under the battering.

“A nerve!” Ji-woo nearly laughed. “Look at her, *she knows it is true*. By the gods and the golden emperor of heaven I have no need for an argument for she has made it herself. Trained by a barbarian, born amidst mayhem, to the wilds she fled at the first sign of danger, abandoning home and, upon her return, bringing bedlam. What does a Ward know but desperation? Merely twenty, she hardly knows herself, how could we know her? The Council does not gamble with cards, why would it with coronation of he who would care for Koryo?”

Among the crowds, nods. An understanding, the beginnings of agreement. He grinned like a skull. What was happening? Was he right? She was trained by the Butcher of Birth. A monster from their past. She had bene raised by a revenant, an Asura who had made her the better fighter, better speaker. And yet she was losing. Who would trust the student of Ananda?

Some part of her had felt it coming, raised an arm just in time, deflected some, as did his own lack of form. Still, the blow came hard, a heel to the side of her head. She fell onto her hands and knees, drained. What was she fighting for? *I* don’t want the throne. That is Sun’s dream. 

Another kick struck her ribs, throwing her across the smooth courtyard flagstones.

“Do you see, Judges? Councilors? Ambassadors? *Vizier*? I should rule!” Ji-woo shouted into the darkening sky. The susurration of approaching rain rushed closer. Lightning crashed above and around them, Ji-woo’s fury framed.

Sun deserved it more than either of them. Hells, even Daewoo deserved it more.

*Don’t win, Hye. *The Sifu’s voice. The beast in the Wilds.* Survive.*

*Which of us most deserves to rule?** *

The answer to that question was not her. But it wasn’t Ji-woo either. Somewhere, a voice, in the back of her mind, goading her. Demanding she could go on. It was from another dimension, drowned by a wall of wind and thunder, half lit by lightning and the blaze of a retreating sun. *Which of us*? It asked again. She pushed herself up, standing. He was, arms raised, celebrating already. 

“Response!” Hye croaked, one arm hugging her side, the other a fist. A patter of rain began, the droplets heavy, smacked into the bloodied stone tiles.

The prince turned, expression black.

“Response,” said Daewoo, barely audible as the skies opened.

“You are right Jiwoo!” Hye shouted above the deluge. “Why would the council gamble? On me, too young, or on *you*, triple-rejected, ever loathed?”

Daewoo’s eyes widened.

“The question, Which of *us*—”she spread her arms wide, spinning, encompassing the crowd,* “most *deserves to rule*? *Our options are not so limited as to we two.*” *Facing the council, she kept Ji-woo in the corner of her gaze. He would not get a second surprise. “Who among us? There are a hundred royals gathered here. Our masters of history, rhetoric, and kumite could rule! Yes, why not one of you? Or all three, triumvirate. A nation, wise, eloquent, and strong.”

“You debase this duel with base pandering,” Ji-woo screeched. 

He threw a kick, attempting to repeat his prior victory. She merely swayed, her feet planted, as his leg carved an unpracticed arc through the rain.

“Judges, must you lower our nation to choose among we two? Who deserves? *Neither* of us.”

Ji-woo screamed at the insult, threw kicks and strikes, powered by stims and fury, but guided only by measly hours of uninspired training by ever disappointed tutors. Amid the rain, Hye now danced and wove, one arm still gripping her side. He shrieked with each strike, desperate.

“This was not the question!”

“Isn’t it?” 

For an instant, he froze, stunned by the audacity of the assertion. She struck him hard, rain shattering in all directions. He stumbled backwards, hands to his bloodied nose and mouth. Red rivulets, thinned by the downpour, ran down his fingers, arms, and chin.

“Which of us deserves? Vizier Daewoo Eun deserves,” Hye spoke from her toes, pulling the words from the palace itself, the stones of Koryo, the rain, the wind, the sun of the world she hoped to better. “Who but one who has shown loyalty and love to three Viceroys? Who is a better champion of what it is to be Koryo, our traditions, our very selves? Should I win, Judges, I do so as a champion of the Vizier. If you deign to grant me victory, you grant her, not me, reign and vice-regency.”

Her hair clung to her face. She began to shiver. The judges, the crowd, all in the miserable cold rain, the dying light of the sun painting the underbelly of the thunder cell pink and orange, stood rapt. The entirety of the Koryo Grand Palace glowed within the shadow, a waining beacon in the dark.

“Which of* us *deserves it*, *you imbecile,” Ji-woo hissed, “ward or prince. You or me.”

“You framed the question, Ji-woo. For someone so wise, so ready, one would have expected more precision had you wished to limit it. Or, perhaps, it was your Oni who failed you. Where is she now, Ji-woo? Or did you mean for her to rule through you? Perhaps that is your true answer to the question—my dear sibling—you believe it is *she *who deserves to rule. You’ve allowed her to rule you.”

Ji-woo looked around in horror.

“You liar! And fool. It cannot be anymore the Vizier than you.” He was apoplectic, his voice shaking in rage and indignation. “You charity cases. Wards. Gods what fools you are to think anyone but a *true *royal should ever rule Koryo.” His voice cracked with fury as he rushed her. “Only Progeny! Only I am worthy. Only I deserve it. Only *me!*” 

He swung at her. She side-side stepped —

— she pictured the Sifu

— falling, arcing electric with the chandelier, burning onto the wendigo

— exhausted, as she challenged the Zaqqum

— tranquil, as the beasts of the Wilds battled around them

— haunted, as they fled the palace

— grinning, as she unleashed the first strike of their duel at the Summer Palace

Vivid, then and now overlayed. Hye studied the moments, rotating them, seeing the angles and felt her own body align. As Ji-woo sailed past, the memory found her muscles. Hye unleashed a full body whip-crack, from heel to two hammer point knuckles. Ji-woo’s exposed cheek was struck with the last of her strength. The side of his face imploded as his head snapped sideways, an arc of rain spraying from his hair. He crumpled. 

The sun had set. Only a pale glow from the horizon now, the storm had spread across the sky. Within the clouds, lightning traced its way, glowing within. The thunder was once again low, rolling off and receding.

Hye turned and bowed to the judges. Exhausted, she fell to her knees before Daewoo and genuflected before her new Viceroy.
