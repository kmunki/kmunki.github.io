Hardly an hour from station-to-station, the train to Mombasa offered opportunity to interrogate the lemur. At first, Illapa had been a bit stumped as to how to manipulate the lemur, until Biby took some seeds out of a pocket on her vest and began eating. With some gentle probing and oblique questioning, Illapa managed to get Biby to admit her favorite foods were, unsurprisingly, grapes and bananas. With her limited grammar and syntax she managed to convey that she loved these foods both for their taste but also for the satisfaction of a job well done, though not stated with this degree of explicitness or coherence. It became clear Biby would do nearly anything for a peach.

Biby was earnest to a fault.

Most uplifted hybrids were. Hybridizing, though largely a science, had more art to it than was widely admitted. The recombination of disparate genetic profiles, even via the medium-cum-catalyst agar, remained imperfect. Hybridizing scientists learned that some skills were easier to add than others. Language, easy. Duplicitousness, difficult. Gratification delay (sufficient to complete a mission, but little more) was simple enough, but strategic action had come along with it, causing other problems. Thus through a process of trial and error, including several errors involving uprisings, rebellions, escapes, murders, and a few particularly horrifying examples of hybrids gaining enough ability to experiment on themselves, the methods of hybridization (outside the Kongo) had largely been reduced to a few targeted outcomes: warriors, spies, messengers, helpers, and companions. But no liars.

When Illapa proposed the change of allegiance, waves of emotions had rippled across the lemur’s face as it attempted to process the nuances of this situation. Sneak, spy, listen, report back— this was the job. Not to negotiate wage or determine the merit of a gig. Her hesitation, whether she knew it or not, was a worthy tactic.

Biby first demanded *all *of the bananas and grapes. Illapa eventually deduced that Biby wished for the *maximum* amount of bananas and grapes Illapa could acquire. Seeing Illapa return with a single bunch of bananas and a single bunch of grapes, Biby seemed quite content. 

A banana was, at once, manically consumed. Thus sated, Biby became forthcoming. 

Whomever gave her missions remained unclear, but the lemur had some grasp on her mission itself: the *Persians* were the client. As to why the Persians wanted to have their own scientist followed, Biby had simply said “Worried.”

Plausible enough. Perhaps Brand was not the only one to have knowledge of the list? No. But with the attacks and disappearances—well, just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean no one is out to get you.

Biby had learned a few other things. Interesting information, mission related or not, earned rewards. She had gathered that the Chinese and a few of the principalities of the Kingdoms were negotiating around production and transport of something quite off the books.

The lemur had struggled to explain, “Many talk, I listen. Kingdoms talk to make. Then talk to move a”—the lemur scrunched her face—“sick blood? No. Make thing?” She was very frustrated, the word outside of her lexicon. “A many small part. Not plant. Not animal. Put together new.”

“A poison?” Illapa asked. The lemur seemed to perk up. “Or just a chemical?”

She pointed at her captor with enthusiasm, “Yes. That. Yes. Chem call.”

“For what?”

“Not say they. Scared. Quiet.”

“What else?”

“Nothing. Real. True.” Said the lemur, clearly terrified of having nothing else to offer. “Listen more, but change to other talks. Different talks hard. Many very hard. Only two speak. Listen few more. Even with magic shot.”

Quaint name for neural plasticiser, thought Illapa. She had dosed with it during basic: strange stuff. Reopened critical windows. Hybrids already have a high tolerance, so with it they’re back in a prime language learning developmental stage for a few weeks, can absorb a whole new vocabulary. Enough to spy at least.

“What Biby tell what for we talk to boss?” Biby asked, “Boss not want any stranger.”

“Tell the truth,” said Illapa. Even for primates, linguistic deception proved difficult. Illapa provided. “You caught a spy, but the spy caught you and wishes an exchange of information. You’ll be rewarded.”

The lemur’s face lit up with delight as she popped another grape into her mouth.
