Hardly an hour from station-to-station, the train to Mombasa offered opportunity to interrogate the lemur. At first, Illapa had been a bit stumped as to how to manipulate the lemur, until Biby took some seeds out of a pocket on her vest and began eating. With some gentle probing and oblique questioning, Illapa managed to get Biby to admit her favorite foods were, unsurprisingly, grapes and bananas. With her limited grammar and syntax she managed to convey that she loved these foods both for their taste but also for the satisfaction of a job well done, though not stated with this degree of explicitness or coherence. It became clear Biby would do nearly anything for a peach.

Biby was earnest to a fault.

Most uplifted hybrids were. Hybridizing, though largely a science, had more art to it than was widely admitted. The recombination of disparate genetic profiles, even via the medium-cum-catalyst agar, remained imperfect. Hybridizing scientists learned that some skills were easier to add than others. Language, easy. Duplicitousness, difficult. Gratification delay (sufficient to complete a mission, but little more) was simple enough, but strategic action had come along with it, causing other problems. Thus through a process of trial and error, including several errors involving uprisings, rebellions, escapes, murders, and a few particularly horrifying examples of hybrids gaining enough ability to experiment on themselves, the methods of hybridization (outside the Kongo) had largely been reduced to a few targeted outcomes: warriors, spies, messengers, helpers, and companions. But no liars.

When Illapa proposed the change of allegiance, waves of emotions had rippled across the lemur’s face as it attempted to process the nuances of this situation. Sneak, spy, listen, report back— this was the job. Not to negotiate wage or determine the merit of a gig. Her hesitation, whether she knew it or not, was a worthy tactic.

Biby first demanded *all *of the bananas and grapes. Illapa eventually deduced that Biby wished for the *maximum* amount of bananas and grapes Illapa could acquire. Seeing Illapa return with a single bunch of bananas and a single bunch of grapes, Biby seemed quite content. 

A banana was, at once, manically consumed. Thus sated, Biby became forthcoming. 

Whomever gave her missions remained unclear, but the lemur had some grasp on her mission itself: the *Persians* were the client. As to why the Persians wanted to have their own scientist followed, Biby had simply said “Worried.”

Plausible enough. Perhaps Brand was not the only one to have knowledge of the list? No. But with the attacks and disappearances—well, just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean no one is out to get you.

Biby had learned a few other things. Interesting information, mission related or not, earned rewards. She had gathered that the Chinese and a few of the principalities of the Kingdoms were negotiating around production and transport of something quite off the books.

The lemur had struggled to explain, “Many talk, I listen. Kingdoms talk to make. Then talk to move a”—the lemur scrunched her face—“sick blood? No. Make thing?” She was very frustrated, the word outside of her lexicon. “A many small part. Not plant. Not animal. Put together new.”

“A poison?” Illapa asked. The lemur seemed to perk up. “Or just a chemical?”

She pointed at her captor with enthusiasm, “Yes. That. Yes. Chem call.”

“For what?”

“Not say they. Scared. Quiet.”

“What else?”

“Nothing. Real. True.” Said the lemur, clearly terrified of having nothing else to offer. “Listen more, but change to other talks. Different talks hard. Many very hard. Only two speak. Listen few more. Even with magic shot.”

Quaint name for neural plasticiser, thought Illapa. She had dosed with it during basic: strange stuff. Reopened critical windows. Hybrids already have a high tolerance, so with it they’re back in a prime language learning developmental stage for a few weeks, can absorb a whole new vocabulary. Enough to spy at least.

“What Biby tell what for we talk to boss?” Biby asked, “Boss not want any stranger.”

“Tell the truth,” said Illapa. Even for primates, linguistic deception proved difficult. Illapa provided. “You caught a spy, but the spy caught you and wishes an exchange of information. You’ll be rewarded.”

The lemur’s face lit up with delight as she popped another grape into her mouth.

Outer Mombasa was a cluster of formerly free floating Drift Cities now all but permanently moored off the coast. In theory, any one of them could weigh anchor and sail off, but only a few had ever done so. For the bulk that remained, their economies had become so intertwined with the advanced industries around Inner Mombasa, Nairobi and the rest of the Valley it would have been foolish to consider leaving. Small factions of secessionists always agitated to cut rope, but could never muster majority. Residents were private—Outer Mombasa offered the option of isolation without the inconvenience of it.

Biby guided Illapa to a skiff shuttle, a hovercraft. The driver, an old salt of a woman, harrumphed a greeting. Biby said a single word, Kulullû. A nod, a key turn and the huge fans roared to life. They slid over the sand and then surf, skipping along the gentle waves, weaving and twisting through the labyrinth, under bridges and between floating domes. Kulullû was a far out cluster of large icebergean structures. For each, a story or two rose above the water while most of the colossal buildings were submerged. Illapa could see the lights twinkling in the ocean below like an inverted night skyline.

The water teemed. An unnatural volume of intelligent animals, looking up, conversing, was only the half of it. All sea life—shoals of silvery fish, pulsing jellies, gliding rays—was abundant; the ocean of childhood picture books made real.

“There are so many animals,” shouted Illapa over the fan drone, “are they all hybrid?”

The salt cackled, “Nay nay! Aye it teems, a good many smart as this one,” she pointed at Biby, “but ’tis a grand garden, a forest preserve! As with the people, though the city be less natural, it also be more safe, so many times many make home here.”

“For their sake I hope they’re smarter than this one, though hard to imagine any hybrid would be,” Illapa said.

“Best adjust your tone, stranger,” said the salt, “your kind and I are outnumbered here. Dagon is not Kongo, but ’tain’t Cuzco either. Humans are the animal least common, and even we all aren’t so keen on outsiders. Watch the water. Many a foreign dolphin or seal with a bit too much hardware and curiosity for their own good left Mombassa scarred and chastened. If they managed to leave at all. And, o course, the further we go out, the rarer *we*”—she pointed a finger back and forth at herself and Illapa, grinning—“are.”

“A fan of barbarism, then?”

The salt shrugged, “All cities are run by animals of a kind, eh? You’ll learn that soon enough, I suppose. We’re here.”

The skiff, fans still roaring, moored alongside a massive building-berg. Its puck-like base was covered with a several story-high glass geodesic dome. Water filled the dome almost to the top. Illapa had seen these before. The building had no core, but was open channel from the dome at the top all the way to the opening to the ocean almost two hundred stories below. A huge number of sea creatures swam about, enjoying the view from far above sea-level.

Inside, the lobby was a great ring, encircling the entire massive circumference of the dome. Interior and exterior walls were clear—Illapa could look out to see sky, in to see sea. Biby lead Illapa to an elevator, little more than a plexiglass sphere, like a bubble, which was nestled into the inner ring of the cylinder. Submerging, it made a slow, smooth descent through the ocean. A handful of sharks and dolphins, along with dozens of fish, octopuses, and the various other creatures were coming and going from the over-surface dome. Within half a minute the sunlight struggled to get through the inky deep blue separating them from the faintly shimmering surface.

Biby, not a static creature to begin, fidgeted and twitched with alacrity. The elevator opened to a tube, clear all around, save for the flat, walkable floor. Interior and exterior lights illuminated ahead of them. 

“Sapa save me!” Exclaimed Illapa, startling as she noticed the huge killer whale, floating motionless outside the tube. “Wouldn’t have expected someone of your scale to be sneaky. Bravo.” 

“Follow me” said the orca, voice low through the tube’s speakers. It began to move along the length of the tube. Tubes, Illapa corrected herself. Looking she could see now a network of them, running through the hollow middle of the inverted sky scraper, like marrow in a bone. Among them were also smaller structures, spheres and domes. The orca guided them through a few branches to a set of doors. The doors opened into a huge chamber of the same disc-dome configuration as above, though much smaller. And reversed—sea now surrounded. The dome was now a precious pocket of air. Where a floor would have been was dark water; a huge circular moon pool. Two small platforms extended into it on either side, with a rim of walkway around it. Biby knelt in a position of supplication, stuck her head in the water and chirruped. She held it there for ten long seconds, then pulled it out. She looked at Illapa and gestured for her to do the same. It was a risk, but with these underworld types you never knew what was needed. Steeling herself, Illapa drew in a deep breath and plunged her head into the water.

She was greeted by two tiger sharks staring up at her, their noses an arms-length from her own. Eyeing them, she counted to ten. They were still as statues; guards, little else. Not sure what the chirrup from Biby was, Illapa merely said, “Hello, I am Agent Illapa of Condor Moray, here to see the Biby’s master,” into the water.

With no obvious movement, the two sharks drifted downward, disappearing into the midnight blue void beyond the light of the dome.

Illapa pulled her head out of the water and, pulling her hair to one side, wrung it out. For minutes, nothing happened, the surface of the moon pool as still as the glass of the dome. Outside and below, schools of fish and other underwater denizens of Outer Mombasa would pass through the dome’s beams of light. If they were interested in Biby or her guest, they showed no signs of it.  Sunlight strained down from above, shifting pillars that dimmed to a dark blue while all around the lights of the submarine buildings twinkled like stars. 

Biby sat still, her terror overpowering her incessant nervous energy into stationary vibration. Though the air and water both held the balmy costal warmth, she was shivering. The orca surfaced.  The two tiger sharks flanked. That salt was not exaggerating, thought Illapa, humans *are* rare here.  Those sharks, she realized, were perhaps not hybrid *enough *for her taste.

The door behind hissed closed. 

“Please!” Biby shouted in fright. She gripped the walkway railing and shook with agitation. The sharks now circled the perimeter.

“Quiet, Biby,” said the orca. “Agent Illapa, this room can flood at a moments notice and that, given the circumstances of your arrival, we are tempted to do so immediately.”

“Please!” Biby asked now, supplicating, “I catch spy. Spy catch me. We see scientist. Good for Olokun. Please!”

“Ahhh,” said Illapa, “I had wondered. So this *is *the home of the Olokun. I had heard rumors…”

The orca grumbled.

“I would not have guessed, however,” continued Illapa, “she was an orca.”

A jet of water, a scoff. The orca had laughed! 

“No,” said the orca, “I am merely a proxy. This audience will determine what is to happen, but if you do not provide a reason to keep you alive, well, the sharks are hungry and I have other business to attend to.”

“Right,” said Illapa, “then let’s not waste either of our time. Your boss and I share a goal: figure out who is after the Persian scientist Kimia Tir. I have the answer. Your spy does not. You do not. The Olokun does not.”

At least, thought Illapa, I *hope* not. But if I could barely keep my eyes on that woman, then no hybrid could. It’s a gamble.

“My money,” she continued, “is that *none *of your other spies know where the Persian is or, more curious, with *whom* she left. Your little friend here couldn’t even look at her. But, let’s say you’ve been most lucky and you *do *know those little bits of trivia. Bravo! You’ve earned your reputation. Even with all that, though, I have an additional missing piece: I know *why* they targeted her. You’ve got to infer motive, whereas I can divulge it. We’ve got business, the Olokun and I. Please send them my way.”

The orca was silent, as were the circling sharks.

“Ah well,” said Illapa, pulling her boots off, “maybe I’m wrong. Maybe you already have all those choice little facts.” She hiked up her pants to her knees and sat on the walkway’s edge. “In which case, I don’t have anything else to offer, may as well get started. No need to fiddle with the room.”

Stretching her feet straight out, then bending at the knee, she slowly submerged them into the water. She rested her arms on the railing, as if on vacation. The circling sharks bumped her shins with their fins.
