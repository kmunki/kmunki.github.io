Uyasimi Kurku sank into her chair, her pale blue robes piling like waves. The Zaqqum’s insectish wooden arms returned the empty jars to the looming tree and retreated into the walls. The lights dimmed. Whatever animus had been, was gone; the Host looked as if waiting for friends to join her hearthside. Even the orange-red agar glow of the head-jars seemed to shift shades from glowering menace to intimate warmth.

“You needn’t stand, ready to spring! Come come. Sit. Relax. It is over.”

Outside, sheets of storm-tossed snowflakes streaked through the beams of the Tower’s outer lights. 

“Please,” she gestured to other chairs, placating now, “sit, listen. Much to say—you wagered well. You too,” she added. Though the Host had not turned, several eyes within jars had turned to the stairs. “Little Trine, you’re ensnared—by choice! How droll. A pun. Join us. May as well attend the victory of your chosen side. Would that you had chosen me! The wheel will turn. Always does. Please sit! All come, sit. And what kind of Host am I then? You must be famished.” 

The twitching biomechanical arms emerged once again, now with small trays of food which they held like waiting butlers. The Host plucked a roll of cheese and meat and nibbled on it delicately. Hye, disbelieving, looked to the Sifu, eyes wide.

“They’ll abide by the coin, Hye.”

Dazed, Hye wandered over and sat in the salon-like cluster of chairs where Kurku held court. Advika did the same, her exhaustion total.

“Like the Viceroy and the Yi Ching,” Hye mumbled, more thought than statement.

“Oh, yes, the sticks.” The Host flicked her wrist, dismissive. “A pale imitation, but it’s not a false analogy, I grant. *Shi bu shi *far outweighs. But Society rituals were not part of our deal. Where, Lucky One, shall we start? Fate has granted you a gift, don’t waste it.”

“Who thought Sun was me?” Hye asked—not so much of the Host, but  of the universe, of herself. “Why did they—”

“An easy one then! That would be Violet. Yes, the corporation. Li Xing’s neo-nation. They knew one of you was Lucky. But not *which* of you. They are… collecting. Gathering. Sheltering? Finding. Taking! Yes, that much is true. The Lost Children. *You, *Child, are both, Lost *and* Lucky. Developed here. You’ve retuned to the womb! Chased here by those who sought you for the miracle of your making. Is that irony? I can never remember. If we count from conception, Lost One, you’ve been ‘alive’ since before even the Long War. Before,”—the Host’s eyes flicked to the Sifu—“that asura blamed for starting it all, Ananda, before she set the plagues loose, *this* place, Penglai, the Tower, existed, part of an Ox plan.”

“Before the war? How old is the Society? Ox plan?”

“Are you sure you want answers, Child? You seem more curious about the Society than yourself. We can change the wager? Eh? Flip again?”

“No, Kurku,” said the Sifu.

“I’m sorry, Uyasimi,” Hye said, reining in her fear. “I will contain my questioning. Please continue.” Hye grabbed a savory thick-crusted pie from the platter and shoved it into her mouth, desperate to remind herself of her hunger and smother her curiosity. She broke off some crumbs, offering them to the triple mouse, which padded over to accept them eagerly.

“Right! Agar and ectogens! Almost two centuries ago, while everyone else debated, hemmed and hawed and fretted at their arrival, *we* acted. Embryos—millions upon millions—were made, tested. A thousand years of human evolution, fifty generations, in months, all in pursuit of an idea: that luck was real, could be bred, engineered. Intentional accidents, chaotic culling, mis-storage and deliberate sabotage, much of it hidden from the very scientists toiling away, would leave a handful. From that lucky pocket, a new generation. For decades, we repeated it. But the true test was not in an embryo, but a person. From the last generation, the luckiest yet, hundreds of embryos were selected and a plan was developed to hide them within the generational facilities of every nation on earth. But Ananda’s War arrived and brought with it more chaos than even the Society would want. The embryos were lost, then forgotten. But the Society persisted and, as it rebuilt, the rumor returned.”

The Host leaned forward now, conspiratorial.

“Li Xing caught the whispers. She believes she is one such Lost one. She may be right. Among me, there are two Lost, now found. And we, being Lost, are lucky, and have helped our larger self survive. There is one Lost, or so Li Xing and her faction believe, who is beyond the rest. The apex—not merely a Lost child, lucky as the rest, but a Lucky Child, a being imbued with the wind of fate forever at her back. Your Curator, she who found you, believed this too, but was of *another* plan—our wily ways, ever shifting—she left you Lost. Li Xing, however, has been searching and, so close to finding, could not wait. A gamble! Take two, get one—a Lucky One. What she did not know was another relict was in waiting, did she asura?”

The Sifu merely stared back, her violet eyes tired.

“Did the Viceroy Min-yoon know… what I was?” Hye asked.

“What you *are*, Child, what you are! No no no. Nothing, she knew nothing of the sort. The Yi Ching *did* though. And, foolish me, I should not have been so hasty with fate. That rolling coin tells me the two of you meeting is no more mere chance than your winning our wager.”

“I don’t feel Lucky.”

“Oh do not mistake it for being *blessed*, Ward. Luck, like that of the Chinese farmer, comes in many forms: injury, danger, death—all manner of suffering. *Survival* is the gift. That you escaped while your sister did not is evidence enough. Your freedom, your Sifu’s, are not merely a frustration to Violet, but a threat. Your royal brother, Prince Ji-woo, sits upon the throne by their hand. Planted, manipulated by their asura, a long placed hedge that, in the moment of crisis, was thrust into place.”

“How you know all—” Hye started, then caught herself, distracted. Trine was pulling at her pant leg. The Host grinned wide. “It does not matter how you know.” Hye steeled herself. “Ji-woo is a puppet of Violet? A corporation now controls Koryo?”

“For now, Koryo. Yes. But, I needn’t remind *you*, sister of the would-be sovereign, soon, too, the Continuum. *This *Selection was the one that mattered. Magistrate power returns to Koryo. Through him, they’ll effectively rule not one nation, but ten, and wield their power with impunity. And, of course, means to make that power more permanent.”

“He… that means *he* knew about the attack. He let it happen.” Hye sat forward, clenching her fists. “Of course, he was so confident. His Oni with an iron rod.”

“Just so,” said the Host.

“I have to stop him!” Hye stood. Trine skittered back, startled.“Sifu, we have to go back. We have to warn the council. Zaqqum, send us back to Koryo.”

“Hye,” said Advika, “how? What will you tell them?”

“I’ll tell them the truth! That Ji-woo is working for Violet, being manipulated by them.”

“And that, what, you know this how?”

Kurku began to laugh. “I do admit, Ward, the old asura has a point. From me, the truth, nothing but, as agreed. But should I send you home, home again so soon, and now, you realize, so very dangerous, the truth is not weapon enough. None will know our name, none will believe we exist should you describe me. ‘The Zaqqum told me! I won a duel of fortune’—ha! How truly desperate you must be, Child. And thusly you would be perceived. A madwoman! Even your last friend, fellow Ward, Vizier Daewoo, vouching for you would matter not. By allying with you, her judgement would be tainted, not your story vindicated. You’ll be laughed from the room and shipped to Violet the next day.”

Hye’s eyes went wide.

“Daewoo is alive?”

“Child! Do you not listen? She has not spoken a word of what she saw. She is powerless.”

“Sifu,” Hye turned from the Host, ignoring her taunts, “please. I can do this. We need to get to Daewoo.”

“I hate to agree with Kurku,” said the Sifu, “but I don’t see how Daewoo makes a difference. She has no power. Help me see. I want to.”

“Yes,” said the Host, still chuckling, “what is your grand plan?”

“You gave it to me, Uyasimi Kurku,” said Hye, picking up Trine, holding them close. The Host arched an eyebrow up to the seam in her skull, intrigued. “I am desperate. Truly. But I still have allies. Send us home through them, through Daewoo. If I am what you say I am, then my grand plan simple: I plan to make my own luck.”

Carved into the permafrost and rock beneath the Tower were tunnels, radiating out into subterranean dark. A tram waited for them like an heirloom. Once gleaming white, the curved plastic body had aged to a yellowed egg-shell. Within, the seats held their plush and the interior flickered to muted life as they approached. Even here, the Zaqqum presided.

Advika pressed a few of the chunky buttons on the console and clicked a dial to their heading. On this command, the tram rotated, the light within casting harsh shadows outwards, like fading campfire in a midnight wood. A single clunk as it locked onto the new tracks and then the not-quite-silent humming of the electric engine grew as they accelerated into the shadow.

“An asura?” Hye asked after a stretch of silence.

A wincing smile found its way to Advika’s face.

“If we hadn’t…”

“No, you never would have known. I . . . would not have told you.”

“Because?”

“It was so long ago.”

“You’re an asura *now. *Aren’t you? Aren’t you always? I don’t know anyone else who only puts half their brain to sleep.”

“No—”Advika shook her head, almost laughing—“well, I wasn’t. Now… I’m not sure. An asura is not the body alone but *embodiment*. Idea made flesh. We were loosed on the world. War-enders. Mission made us, purpose defined us. I retain… too much of what I once was. I am old, Hye, but time is not agar. No matter what the cliches claim, not all wounds heal.”

Advika looked back along the line of the tram towards the tower.

“What are you then?”

Advika turned to Hye, locking eyes.

“I’m your rearer,” she said, almost incredulous, “Yours and Sun’s. I’ve lived long, Hye, and had many lives, and tried to be many things. Of all of them, it is the purpose I’ve cherished most. The two of you have helped me find more of myself. Yes, I’m spliced enough to give an uplift pause, but I’m no longer an asura. I’m something else. Some*one* else. Someone lucky enough that destiny put us together.”
