Illapa awoke out of a fever dream. Cold sweat clung to her face. Her hand still burned, but now only flares of pain shivered through her. Msizi’s caring face appeared, then Eshma’s, creased with discomfort and concern. Hours blended together. Awful sounds from beyond the door. Consciousness did not yet bring lucidity. As her mind crawled out of the grogginess, it stumbled across a handful of facts: she was still alive, but that had been in question; she was damp and cold, they were still in the refrigerator; the can of beans she had wedged into the door handle remained, the Moon—what he had become—was still outside. Bleary eyed, she sat up. A nest of sheets and packing materials surrounded her. The earthy tang of early decay permeated the air. Several large containers had been emptied of condiments for… ah yes, right, they had been in here for days. Clever use of vessels with tight sealing lids.

Illapa went to speak, but a hand had been pressed over her mouth—Msizi’s.

“You’re awake, and, for the first time, that hand of yours doesn’t look angry enough to kill the rest of you. Good.” She was whispering, her lips brushing Illapa’s ear. “The ghul is still outside. Eshma keeps calling it a preta but it’s no ghost. Hungry though, that much is true. We have to be quiet. It keeps checking the window but it can’t see us back here.”

Illapa nodded her understanding. Msizi removed her hand.

“How long has it been?”

“Four miserable days and nights,” said Eshma, adjusting herself within her cocoon of blankets. “I have eaten more herring than I ever wish to again.”

“No can opener in here,” said Msizi. “Here.” She held out a plastic bottle with some blue colored liquid. “It’s an exercise drink. Not water but between this and the coconut milk we’re surviving.”

Illapa drank. The cracks in her lips stung and the paste in her mouth thined.

“Slow,” said Msizi as Illapa began to gulp, “we don’t know if your stomach is ready.”

Illapa realized her hand was shaking as she set the bottle down. Waves of heat and pain rolled through her. Four days, by the Sapa, she should be dead. A scratch on the hand from that thing had nearly killed her.

“What—” Illapa struggled to speak, expelling breaths through pursed lips to calm herself. “What do we know?”

“It is a preta!” Eshma hissed, shuffling closer, blankets pulled over her head and tucked under her chin. “A corpse eater!”

“Eshma,” Msizi chided, “please. We have observed it when we could. At first we just listened, too terrified to look out the window. We would hear clanking and thunking, occasionally the scrape of its nails on metal, of the door or through the kitchen. Then we began to hear water drawn. The oven. It…” Msizi shuddered.

“It butchered the bodies,” said Eshma. “Carving up the corpses of all those people it killed.”

“Piles,” said Msizi, her eyes unfocusing as her minds eye repainted the remembered horror, “piles of hands. Of legs. Of torsos. Of heads. It began cooking them. Roasting the biggest pieces of muscle, tossing the rest into a huge stock pot with water. Then it began to eat.”

“And eat, and eat. Bottomless,” said Eshma.

“It passes out for almost an hour after it does. It just lays there, panting. You can see the heat rising off of it.”

“It’s growing.”

“*Growing?*” Illapa finally asked.

“It’s much bigger. Muscled. And… it has bones sticking out of it, covering it. Like tusks and armor.”

Illapa’s eyes narrowed as she listened, burrowing into her memories.
