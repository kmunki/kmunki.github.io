Illapa awoke out of a fever dream. Cold sweat clung to her face. Her hand still burned, but now only flares of pain shivered through her. Msizi’s caring face appeared, then Eshma’s, creased with discomfort and concern. Hours blended together. Awful sounds from beyond the door. Consciousness did not yet bring lucidity. As her mind crawled out of the grogginess, it stumbled across a handful of facts: she was still alive, but that had been in question; she was damp and cold, they were still in the refrigerator; the can of beans she had wedged into the door handle remained, the Moon—what he had become—was still outside. Bleary eyed, she sat up. A nest of sheets and packing materials surrounded her. The earthy tang of early decay permeated the air. Several large containers had been emptied of condiments for… ah yes, right, they had been in here for days. Clever use of vessels with tight sealing lids.

Illapa went to speak, but a hand had been pressed over her mouth—Msizi’s.

“You’re awake, and, for the first time, that hand of yours doesn’t look angry enough to kill the rest of you. Good.” She was whispering, her lips brushing Illapa’s ear. “The ghul is still outside. Eshma keeps calling it a preta but it’s no ghost. Hungry though, that much is true. We have to be quiet. It keeps checking the window but it can’t see us back here.”

Illapa nodded her understanding. Msizi removed her hand.

“How long has it been?”

“Four miserable days and nights,” said Eshma, adjusting herself within her cocoon of blankets. “I have eaten more herring than I ever wish to again.”

“No can opener in here,” said Msizi. “Here.” She held out a plastic bottle with some blue colored liquid. “It’s an exercise drink. Not water but between this and the coconut milk we’re surviving.”

Illapa drank. The cracks in her lips stung and the paste in her mouth thined.

“Slow,” said Msizi as Illapa began to gulp, “we don’t know if your stomach is ready.”

Illapa realized her hand was shaking as she set the bottle down. Waves of heat and pain rolled through her. Four days, by the Sapa, she should be dead. A scratch on the hand from that thing had nearly killed her.

“What—” Illapa struggled to speak, expelling breaths through pursed lips to calm herself. “What do we know?”

“It is a preta!” Eshma hissed, shuffling closer, blankets pulled over her head and tucked under her chin. “A corpse eater!”

“Eshma,” Msizi chided, “please. We have observed it when we could. At first we just listened, too terrified to look out the window. We would hear clanking and thunking, occasionally the scrape of its nails on metal, of the door or through the kitchen. Then we began to hear water drawn. The oven. It…” Msizi shuddered.

“It butchered the bodies,” said Eshma. “Carving up the corpses of all those people it killed.”

“Piles,” said Msizi, her eyes unfocusing as her minds eye repainted the remembered horror, “piles of hands. Of legs. Of torsos. Of heads. It began cooking them. Roasting the biggest pieces of muscle, tossing the rest into a huge stock pot with water. Then it began to eat.”

“And eat, and eat. Bottomless,” said Eshma.

“It passes out for almost an hour after it does. It just lays there, panting. You can see the heat rising off of it.”

“It’s growing.”

“*Growing?*” Illapa finally asked.

“It’s much bigger. Muscled. And… it has bones sticking out of it, covering it. Like tusks and armor.”

Illapa’s eyes narrowed as she listened, burrowing into her memories.

“What are we looking at,” asked Msizi, wrapped in one of the smuggled sheets, over which she wore a rice-bag cloak.

“I don’t know,” said Illapa, sitting into the nest of packaging, “There were stories of cannibalistic monstrosities from the war, but nothing like this. If we survive I’ll have to ask our Master of Intelligence what the hell it is. If we survive.”

“I don’t want to die in here.”

“Nor I. But this is a weapon of some kind. A war-relic level threat. I would hardly believe it myself, had I not seen more things first-hand that *shouldn’t* exist anymore—or that *everyone* said was just a myth—in the last *month* than I had the rest of my life prior. Something extremely strange is happening.” Illapa turned from the window, lowering herself to the floor, resting her back against a shelf of dewy, white-green lettuce.

“Yes. This isn’t supposed to happen.” Said Eshma, from under a pile of disinterred packing-shavings. Glints of jewels flashed from beneath the wood fluff.

There was a scraping and bumping. The creature was awakening, stirring. Illapa once again surveyed and found not only was the creature up, it was staring at the door. Had it heard them? They had been barely whispering! How had it heard? 

Illapa dropped down as it seemed to focus more intently on the window. She gestured to the others *get back, get hidden*. They had slept in the far back, creating a sense of safety, to not be immediately near the door.

Illapa found a vantage, where she could see through the shelving without being seen. A face now filled the fridge door window. It was half skull, the lips and nose gone, the skin of the face gaunt. It was no longer human. Where there had been the flat, square teeth of an omnivore were things serrated, for tearing, like shards of broken bone. They were chaotically arranged, as though assembled makeshift. Hot breath flared from its gaping sinus holes, and the eyes, blood shot and bugged in their lidless orbits, rolled wildly. The creature tilted its head back and forth, putting one eye to the window, then the other, moving its entire body up and down to try to rotate for a better view.

Methodical, it tried the door. The can of beans complained each time it tested the handle.

For minutes they sat in silent terror.

Twice it huffed, as if done, left for a few seconds, then whipped back to the window, more enraged than before, trying to catch them off guard. Finally it gave up and returned to its meal.

Huddled in the back of the fridge, in almost inaudible whispers and gestures, they continued their conversation.

“No one is coming,” said Msizi.

“This is absurd!” Said Eshma. “ An ill designed cell, holding three, meant for none!”

“I need to get back to my room.” Eshma and Msizi turned to Illapa, disbelieving. “Which means opening the fridge and dealing with that thing.”

“Even if,” said Eshma in a hissing whisper, “we *could* get the fridge door open quietly, even if we *could* sneak past the horrific culinary experiments while the monster still slept. Why? For what?”

“There are several problems. I have no gun. The creature is, by now, superhuman in size and strength. It likely has better senses than us now as well.” 

“But it seems… well,” said Msizi, “like it’s suffered intense brain damage?”

“*Right,*” said Illapa, “it is now also dumb, and getting dumber. So we have to out smart it. A thing with basic drives is easy to trick.” 

“But how stupid is it?” Eshma asked, “It can cook, it tried to trick us. It can plan too!” Both Illapa and Msizi put fingers to their lips. She rolled her eyes and mouthed a sarcastic silent apology, then continued, “It must have been designed to survive alone.”

“But it was not likely designed to survive long,” corrected Illapa, “Things like this, as best I know, were used to infect an *enemy* soldier. You still want it to die at the end, just to take as many of its compatriots with it as possible in the process. As it gets stronger, it gets more bestial. We rely on that.”

“How much stronger can it get?” Eshma asked.

“There is still a lot of…” Illapa hesitated, “meat out there. I suspect we are at the beginning. Not the end. If we don’t get out, it will, eventually, get in.”

For a moment all three were quiet as their imaginations painted separate, gruesome scenarios with a similar palette.

Eshma, chastened, said, “well, that’s not how I planned to go. So let’s get going.”

Half-naked, huddled in sheets and wood shavings, surrounded by dewy produce, hanging meats, and shelves of cans and jars, they began to scheme.

The sounds in the kitchen had stopped for, best Illapa could guess, at least twenty minutes. They would need at least ten for the initial part of the plan. Silent as a ghost, she crept to the door and peered through the window. No ghul. It wasn’t anywhere she could see. Somewhat panicked, she pressed her face to the window and nearly stumbled backwards in shock when she saw it. The ghul had put itself to sleep almost directly in front of the fridge door. They would have barely two feet of play to swing the door open and squeeze out. It must have suspected.

She turned to Msizi and signaled as much, but they were go all the same. With agonizing care, she removed the can from the latch, the whispers of scraping metal feeling like screams. She set the can down and, hand braced on the handle, once again looked out. The rapid rise and fall of the creature’s chest told her it was still in its metabolic catalepsy. This time it was facing them. She signaled Msizi and the ambassador over. They had no chance to practice, but the instructions were simple enough. Illapa would open the door, the ambassador would hold in that precise position as they left, drifting the door all but closed until they returned.

With a gentle push, Illapa depressed the lever and leaned against the door, putting every effort into controlling her movements. The sound of the rubber seal pealing away from the metal as she opened the door may as well have been the ripping of a ship in half. Every sound thundered in her ears. Go slow, be careful, watch. Her face never left the frame of the door as it swung open millimeter by millimeter. For all three, opening the door felt as though it took somewhere between three minutes and three millennia. The heat from the room poured through the door, the umami-sweet pork smell of cooked people was thick in the air. Involuntary saliva flooded their mouths. Illapa signaled and Ambassador Eshma, trembling, took the lever and then did her best impression of a statue.
