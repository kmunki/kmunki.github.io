The effects also make the wearer substantially more willing to accept hierarchical guidance due to several swarm insect patterns integrated into the suit.

## Wendigo

An expression of a specific infection designed to cause horror in enemies. After taking over a human host, the fungo-virus generates a rabies and cordycepts like infection while also modifying the body. The creature (what remains is no longer human) then consumes as many calories as possible, usually by killing other nearby humans and dragging them off to be eaten. During this time rapid growth and mutation occurs, so rapidly that the skin often bursts or elements misform. The result is a constantly bleeding, misshapen, hulk of a creature that cannot be reasoned with. It's attacks do not create new ghuls. It is not a zombie. It is merely a killing machine.
