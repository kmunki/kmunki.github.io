## The Long War

[To be expanded]

## Ogumo

Soldiers who have been fused into a symbiotic relationship with a bio-suit. As a result, they are substantially stronger and better soldiers. The suit slowly integrates with the brain of the wearer, making sustained usage of the suits dangerous. A Rakshasa is the permanent result of a suit worn too long. Removal of the suit is fatal. The effects also make the wearer substantially more willing to accept hierarchical guidance due to several swarm insect patterns integrated into the suit.

## War-relic

Any technology left over from the war no longer in regular use. Highly coveted because they are often dangerous, powerful, and the knowledge or will or scale of production required to reproduce them has been lost.

## Wendigo

An expression of a specific infection designed to cause horror in enemies. After taking over a human host, the fungo-virus generates a rabies and cordycepts like infection while also modifying the body. The creature (what remains is no longer human) then consumes as many calories as possible, usually by killing other nearby humans and dragging them off to be eaten. During this time rapid growth and mutation occurs, so rapidly that the skin often bursts or elements misform. The result is a constantly bleeding, misshapen, hulk of a creature that cannot be reasoned with. It's attacks do not create new ghuls. It is not a zombie. It is merely a killing machine.
