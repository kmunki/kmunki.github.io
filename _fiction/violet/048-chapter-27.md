Flipping through the reports Vidya had sent, Illapa found herself shaking her head, impressed. The two, Vidya and the Olokun, both of the ilk infovore, had bristled at first upon meeting, like two predators discovering shared territory. Hunger for knowledge and fear of Violet, however, created a fast alliance. Little else like a shared enemy for forging peace, eh?

Potent little announcement that had been at Uplift—bravo, Violet, bravo. Ten minutes of stage time and the geopolitical order goes skittering sideways like a crab on ice. Just weeks ago the world had been chugging along just fine. Sure, there were border skirmishes. On occasion, war-relics would be found and kill off a small town or what have you—but that was expected! Ambient misery had, for years now, been mostly stable. That was a spook’s job: stability. Keep civilization contained. Against the pirates, pseudoplagues, and rogue hybrids of edge-lands what a dream even the seediest and cruelest parts of a city could be. Her job, that of every assassin and spy and intelligence agent on the planet, was to keep civilization civil, the Wilds wild.

On a global scale, quite a bit goes wrong every a few days. Narrowing it down to relevant bits is why Illapa tolerated Vidya’s wunderkind attitude and twee scribblings in the margins. The Uplift announcement, the list—there was a bigger plan. Such conspiracy was the domain of the Olokun. Together, the two had boiled what should have been a half-inch thick report into two paragraphs:

*Geopolitical norms are destabilized. Violet’s announcement has triggered a rash of emigration reform bills, even some outright bans, along with toothless threats of boycott, tariffs, and embargo. Markets are volatile.** *

*Beneath the obvious are more disturbing trends.** *

*Most pressing are the attacks on multiple high ranking officials homes, resulting in the “deaths” of six heads of state and the confirmed abduction of at least thirteen, if not more, individuals of meaningful prominence. Most remarkable is Yi In-Yeong, Viceregent of Koryo, head of the Joseon Dynasty, and the abduction of two of her fledgling royal daughters. Princess Yi Seong-ma, known as Sun, was one of several royal progeny (the Koryo are the last genetic oligarchicy) competing for Viceregency. The next Viceroy will become Chief Magistrate of the Continuum when power transitions in the coming years. Song-ma’s sister, Ward Hyeon Bong-cha, and their rearer-tutor, Sifu Advika Shidao, are missing presumed dead after the attack as well. Like the assaults on the regional chancellor of Iranian Persia and the Hamazan Inca, among other less notables, the attack was against a suzerainty. **	**Be a dear and get us plausible information on what the hell happened in Koryo.* *I’ve booked you on the catamaran from Mombasa to Pyongyang. From there it’s a two hour ride into the mountains, a moto will be waiting for you at the station. To stop Violet, The Olokun and I need information. Go get it.*

At the entrance to the palace stood a bedraggled woman in military ceremonial dress who seemed to be maintaining a sense of authority and decorum through sheer willpower alone.

“And you are?” The guard sighed it more than she said it.

“Special Agent Illapa, here on behalf of Condor Moray and the UKK, joint operation.”

“Oh fantastic,” she held the bridge of her nose. “Commander Ryong, former Head of the Guard for the New Joseon Dynasty. Now, head of guarding the entrance to the Summer Palace. What is it I can do for you, honorable Agent?”

Honorable, eh? Well at least this Ryong knew what Illapa was and that her inflated title for a minor royal’s security guard hadn’t gone to her head.

“I’ve read the report, I have a sense of what happened here. I’m wondering if I can walk around the space.”

“A reasonable request. I’d be inclined to say yes if I hadn’t been ordered to say ‘No.’ Acting Viceroy Yi Ji-woo has declared this an internal matter, only to be assessed by my… I mean, sorry, *our* internal team. Our findings will be classified for reasons of ‘national security’.”

Ryong bracketed the phrase with her fingers, and rolled her eyes.

“Am I detecting dissension in the ranks?”

“Don’t be shitty,” said Commander Ryong, “I’ve been demoted to front door duty. One of our Lieutenants, Pak Ho is running the show now. She’s smart enough, does a decent job, but she’s fanatically loyal to Ji-woo. He’s made her acting Captain of the Investigation and, though I technically out rank her, in the scope of this investigation she has final say. I could override her, but only if the Acting Viceroy backs me. Given she’s relaying his orders, well, here I am.”

Illapa nodded. Military life was filled with such compromises. The chain of command was occasionally hitched to a wagon driven by a toothless farmer and pulled by stubborn mules.

Hands on her hips, Illapa looked around. No real evidence of an attack, she didn’t have much to go on besides the guard’s oblique references to an investigation. Even the road up looked to have been already re-paved, little but tree stumps left where it had all happened. The whole place looked like a museum, pristine and empty.

“Where is everyone?”

“There is a team of mercs inside, so don’t be cute. Not sure how you Inka do things, but conking me on the head and steeling my uniform like in the movies won’t get the job done, you’ll be shot to ribbons once you’re inside. They don’t want me in there any more than you.”

“You’ve me there. Upon my honor”—Illapa put a hand in the air—“no conking. Now, that still doesn’t answer my question, does it then?”

Ryong let her head tilt back, her jaw slack, closed her eyes and sighed with exasperation.

“Funeral,” she said to the sky before bringing face forward again, “or funeral prep.”

“For In-yeong?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“If you had I wouldn’t have asked it, eh? Interesting. It’s empty save you and some mercs on patrol for your friend Pak. Whole palace is off limits then? Any, ah, exceptions?”

“If you’re trying to bribe me, it’s not going to be terribly difficult. I’ll let you in just on a promise: pop one of those thugs Pak hired for added protection in the mouth and we’ll call it even. Pak is at least pretending to act within the rules and showing me some respect. Those mercenaries are real bastards.”

“Oh, do tell. From out west?”

“Yeah, some byeong-shin stim-brained Malians. They’re all inside, so whatever it is they’re guarding, it ain’t the palace proper. No no, that’s still *my* stupid job.”

“Why are you being so open with me?”

“Do you really care?”

“At first no, you weren’t in my way and one fewer guard to negotiate with was all I needed. But I’ve worked with enough Koryo in the field to know that you don’t break rank or lose face unless something a lot more serious is going on. What aren’t you telling me?”

Ryong dropped her shoulders and sighed a big sigh. 

“We lost our Viceroy last week. She was haughty, tedious, exhausting but she is—was—a good Viceroy. Duty came first. She didn’t waver. We had talked, or well,” Ryong hesitated, some shame creeping into her voice, “I was standing nearby when conversations were happening. You know the gig, you hear things.” 

Illapa nodded, understanding. You don’t work security without learning a good bit of unmentionables. You are part of the scenery, a gun with no eyes and no ears save for threats and enemies. Secrets slide off your brain. Only no human worked that way. 

“Ji-woo was a black sheep. A partier and a fool, bringing schemes his fellow wealthy scions from other nations had cooked up to votes that got laughed at rather than shouted down. Shadow or no, rich kids like him prefer one another’s company to their parents or siblings. He wasn’t malicious, just… useless. A real shit.”

“Where’s this going?”

“Where it’s going,” Ryong’s voice dropped, conspiratorial as she leaned in close, “is that Ji-woo was never considered having anything resembling a real shot at Selection. No one ever expected his name to even enter contention. Seong-ma wasn’t guaranteed, far from it, but two others, Jaehwa and Myung-suk were right there after her. Ji-woo shouldn’t have even been a close fourth. Yet, a few weeks ago, he ranted at In-Yeong about how this time was different. He kept saying, ‘I’m an ogre with an iron rod’ whatever that means. The day of her abdication, he announces. We’re attacked *that night*. Not twelve hours later, during the emergency selection, Jaehwa and Myung-suk were both out of country, dealing with matters of state like the real candidates they were. Seong-ma missing, along with her sister and their Sifu. So Ji-woo just *happens *to be here and another sibling, Duri, a real ding-dong if you ask me, suddenly becomes eloquent and makes a speech about how the Koryo need to show strength and decisiveness, and having a leader in the palace *now *matters more than who the official leader is tomorrow. So they voted him in as acting Viceroy. It’s supposed to be temporary but the next day these toughs show up. Jaehwa and Myung-suk get back and he accuses *them *of conspiring to knock out their competition.”

“Where are they now?”

“Still in Busan. They’re not in danger, or don’t seem to be, they’re just being questioned by state intelligence. It’s all a show.”

“This feels pretty thin.”

“Thin!” Ryong hissed, stifling a shout, “Now you listen to me. I know how Condor operates and that the UKK has serious spooks. If they sent you, *you *all the way out here, something big is up, right? You’re not going to leave here having asked some wash-up guard a few questions and calling it a day. All of this is wrong way beyond whatever seems to be happening. This”—Ryong’s eyes darted back and forth as her mind cobbled together bits of evidence—“this is bigger than just Koryo isn’t it?”

“I can neither confirm nor deny—”

“See! See I knew it. I *knew it,*” Ryong fiddled with her vest, opening a half dozen velcro’d pockets before finding what she wanted, a small key. “Here, it’s the key to the girls’ tutor’s room. Sifu Advika Shidao. Heaven’s emperor I wish she was here. You two’d have a few things to discuss.”

“Haven’t the mercs already flipped it?”

“No, I said the master key wouldn’t work on it, which is true, and that we didn’t have a spare, which is not true. A former Viceroy, two before In-yeong, and the tutor had an… odd relationship. Ji-woo couldn’t find a good reason to go busting up the place, which the mandarins were *extremely *adamant he did not do. She had a reputation.”

“They’re not just going to let me stroll in there are they.”

“Nope. Good luck.”

“How far can I get before it becomes a problem.”

“Now the official answer is you should walk through the main hall, check in with the guard post there, let them know I’ve sent you along. Since I wasn’t supposed to do that, you’ll get sent back and that will be that.”

“Unofficial?”

“It’s pretty hard to keep track of everything right now. You wouldn’t believe it but if someone tried, it wouldn’t be too difficult to sneak through the gardens between the main building and the library, then saunter through there and over to the Sifu’s, which is across the large lawn. We know it’s a problem, but who would be sneaking in here? We’re so far up in the mountains. We can’t secure everything.”

“Thanks for your time.”

“Remember our deal.” Ryong pantomimed punching her own face just under the nose. “In the mouth.”

“Consider it done.”
