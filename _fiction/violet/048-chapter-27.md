Flipping through the reports Vidya had sent, Illapa found herself shaking her head, impressed. The two, Vidya and the Olokun, both of the ilk infovore, had bristled at first upon meeting, like two predators discovering shared territory. Hunger for knowledge and fear of Violet, however, created a fast alliance. Little else like a shared enemy for forging peace, eh?

Potent little announcement that had been at Uplift—bravo, Violet, bravo. Ten minutes of stage time and the geopolitical order goes skittering sideways like a crab on ice. Just weeks ago the world had been chugging along just fine. Sure, there were border skirmishes. On occasion, war-relics would be found and kill off a small town or what have you—but that was expected! Ambient misery had, for years now, been mostly stable. That was a spook’s job: stability. Keep civilization contained. Against the pirates, pseudoplagues, and rogue hybrids of edge-lands what a dream even the seediest and cruelest parts of a city could be. Her job, that of every assassin and spy and intelligence agent on the planet, was to keep civilization civil, the Wilds wild.

On a global scale, quite a bit goes wrong every a few days. Narrowing it down to relevant bits is why Illapa tolerated Vidya’s wunderkind attitude and twee scribblings in the margins. The Uplift announcement, the list—there was a bigger plan. Such conspiracy was the domain of the Olokun. Together, the two had boiled what should have been a half-inch thick report into two paragraphs:

*Geopolitical norms are destabilized. Violet’s announcement has triggered a rash of emigration reform bills, even some outright bans, along with toothless threats of boycott, tariffs, and embargo. Markets are volatile.** *

*Beneath the obvious are more disturbing trends.** *

*Most pressing are the attacks on multiple high ranking officials homes, resulting in the “deaths” of six heads of state and the confirmed abduction of at least thirteen, if not more, individuals of meaningful prominence. Most remarkable is Yi In-Yeong, Viceregent of Koryo, head of the Joseon Dynasty, and the abduction of two of her fledgling royal daughters. Princess Yi Seong-ma, known as Sun, was one of several royal progeny (the Koryo are the last genetic oligarchicy) competing for Viceregency. The next Viceroy will become Chief Magistrate of the Continuum when power transitions in the coming years. Song-ma’s sister, Ward Hyeon Bong-cha, and their rearer-tutor, Sifu Advika Shidao, are missing presumed dead after the attack as well. Like the assaults on the regional chancellor of Iranian Persia and the Hamazan Inca, among other less notables, the attack was against a suzerainty. **	**Be a dear and get us plausible information on what the hell happened in Koryo.* *I’ve booked you on the catamaran from Mombasa to Pyongyang. From there it’s a two hour ride into the mountains, a moto will be waiting for you at the station. To stop Violet, The Olokun and I need information. Go get it.*
