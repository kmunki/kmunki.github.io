            <p>"Agar, that viscous, amber-red gel upon which our modern world was built, had humble beginnings as nourishment for bacterial cultures. Little more than simple food for simple life, agar allowed exponential growth in a space of easy observation. In many ways it was already the substrate of science by the early 1800s, almost a half century before the discoveries at Rimac Madrasa up at Machu Picchu set the biological revolution in motion.</p>
            <p>Though now taken for granted, the chances that almost alchemical substrate we now call agar was discovered <em>at all,</em> let alone as early as it was, is incredible; as in, there are still days I cannot entirely give credence to the fact that it happened. A biological skeleton key. All the more astounding is that that such a gift of life was the antecedent of the Long War, its Shadow, and the near two billion deaths resulting thus far. What are we to make of this – Irony? Tragedy? Proof we are more chimp than bonobo? – I am not sure. By the turn of the last century, agar stretched healthy lives well into the one-fifty range, yet the average life-span by the 1990s was still barely two thirds that.</p>
            <p>Why, we must ask ourselves, why is it in the battle against death we create so much of it?"</p>
