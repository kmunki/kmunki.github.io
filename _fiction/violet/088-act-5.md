# Act 5: Aleatory Syzygy

“Agar, that viscous, amber-red gel upon which our modern world was built, had humble beginnings as nourishment for bacterial cultures. Little more than simple food for simple life, agar allowed exponential growth in a space of easy observation. In many ways it was already the substrate of science by the early 1800s, almost a half century before the discoveries at Rimac Madrasa up at Machu Picchu set the biological revolution in motion.

Though now taken for granted, the chances that almost alchemical substrate we now call agar was discovered *at all,* let alone as early as it was, is incredible; as in, there are still days I cannot entirely give credence to the fact that it happened. A biological skeleton key. All the more astounding is that that such a gift of life was the antecedent of the Long War, its Shadow, and the near two billion deaths resulting thus far. What are we to make of this – Irony? Tragedy? Proof we are more chimp than bonobo? – I am not sure. By the turn of the last century, agar stretched healthy lives well into the one-fifty range, yet the average life-span by the 1990s was still barely two thirds that. 

Why, we must ask ourselves, why is it in the battle against death we create so much of it?”
