As promised, the gardens were empty of guards. Royals projected power, in part, via fearlessness—the palace was no fortress. A good architect, however, knew how to design for both. Those wide open lawns? Hard to sneak across—just open space, a moat of close-cropped grass, coy ponds, and labyrinthine walk-ways among them. Hosting a grand ball? No better place for overheated guests or budding paramours to stroll in the cool mountain air. Attempting a coup? Well now you had thirty meters of exposure where in your trespass would be made public and nary a bush, tree, nor statue could be found to hide behind.

Crouched behind a border topiary at the edge of the lawn, Illapa found a worthy vantage. The guard had not exaggerated; the mercenaries were kitted for a proper war. Tactical garb, heavy body armor, rifles at the ready, side arms and knives strapped to thighs, a cross-body strap of grenades and magazines. Standard issue for top-of-the-line mercs. Odd for guard duty though. Not much else stood out beyond a patch on one of their shoulders, which showed a female warrior with a sword and symbol, a vertical red line with two red curves facing away from each other at the top and bottom.

The old Sifu’s guest house was set back into the woods, along one of the strolling paths. Over the centuries, the palace had hosted its share of monks. Small dorms, huts, and shrines could be found nestled here and there, beyond the main palace grounds. Hers was small, yes, but hardly a hovel. Like the rest of the palace, it had a dark green tile roof and was painted with the layered, geometric patterns from the era of its construction.

The inside was ascetic elegance. A few robes on pegs. A low bed. A shelf with a couple dozen books, mostly classics. Brush calligraphy scrolls of restrained grace hung from the walls. Windows overlooked the woods and gardens. Forest smells, petrichor, drifted in on the breeze through the open wooden casements. Save the rustle of the still damp last leaves of autumn and the sound of the self-made rain of dripping trees, it was quiet, calm. 

Illapa started with the books, then behind the scrolls. Nothing. Same for the lone desk and under the bed. Whatever might be in here, then, was either sacred or secret.

So let’s look again.

Illapa approached the space this time not as a simple burglar, but as a counterspy. Jostling pegs, knocking for hollow spaces, half-opening drawers and sticking her hand for—ah, there it was—a button. She depressed it. A click came from the floor. Illapa froze and stared at the source of the sound, her ears straining for a ticking, hissing, clicking—any sign of booby trap at all. For a long, silent minute, she waited for some indication that there was further trickery. None appeared. 

With caution, she squatted next to the small gap that had appeared on the floor. She shifted, tensing her legs, primed to launch away at an instant. With two fingers, she lifted the floor hatch, slow and gentle, feeling for tension and—oop, steady now—she saw the trip wire. Half-again lowering the hatch, she reached in and unhooked the wire, and opened the hatch fully. The hidden vault was small, perhaps a bit more than a meter square. Inside was a case, a key fob, and a notebook. The case was well-worn aluminum, reinforced with ribbing and locked by two clasps at the top, its hinges and seam covered, and a handle that lay flat when not in use. Flipping through the notebook, it was in Chinese; but not just that, it was in a kind of cypher. Another puzzle for Vidya. Finally, the key fob, clearly to a vehicle. It was a key blade embedded in what looked like chip of obsidian, but the shape felt more grown than hewn. Well then, let’s see if we can’t find your pair in the garage.

The problem, now, was that lovely moat of lawn. Several mercenaries patrolled. A lone, profoundly bored merc paced back and forth through the route between Illapa and the garage. Illapa knew patrol boredom. Circuit after circuit, looking at the same empty hallways, or fields, or peering into the empty woods for what felt like the ten-thousandth time, noting that, once again, the noise was, as the last time, a chipmunk. 

But for a palace that had just been attacked, it was not the attitude she would have expected. Patrol is only mindless when you know there is no threat. 

Unless they were in on it. 

This wasn’t added security, but an occupying force. Perhaps Ryong wasn’t paranoid. 

Illapa stood and, with the confidence of an oblivious civilian who means well, she sauntered, then jogged towards the merc. After a flicker of disbelief, the merc’s rifle raised.

“Excuse me! Hello! Oh thank goodness excuse me!” Illapa waived as if she were not about to be shot, but, instead, was in danger of losing their attention.

“Freeze or I will shoot! What are you doing here?”

“Oh mercy, I’m so sorry, don’t shoot don’t shoot! Just here for acting Viceroy Ji-woo, sent by, his, ah, well, you know, how shall I put this delicately, *our mutual backers?*”

It was a gamble. But the pieces were there. The aluminum case looked like it could catch a few rounds otherwise.

The merc stared at Illapa’s nebbish grin and proffered briefcase. Bobbing her head back and forth for a moment in deliberation, she then lowered her gun and waived Illapa over.

“Right!” Said Illapa, trotting over, “Easy to get lost in this place, directions were not what I’d hoped?”

“Yeah yeah. By the Monkey’s balls you mandarins are all the sa—“

Illapa had taken her last step more as lunge, letting the briefcase swing fully back before planting both feet she let every kilo of momentum accelerate the bottom corner of the brief case up and into the merc’s jaw. The merc dropped. A few teeth had shattered and the poor thing’s mandible would be soaking in an agar cast for a week if she wasn’t shot for incompetence, but that’s part why the gig pays what it does, eh? Illapa grabbed the merc’s vest by the collar and dragged her against the wall of the palace, as if napping. She ripped off the patch on the shoulder and bounded away towards the garage.

The garage itself was carved out of the mountain, a beautiful cave with a wide, arched opening. A small fleet of royal motos, glossy and heavy, along with a few litters of varying sizes comprised most of the collection. A half dozen muddied military motos, bulky and armored, squatted off to the side. A dent in the floor caught her eye—an impact crater, radiating cracks. Eagle thunder, what could have done that? She mimicked a strike, recreating the scene. Turning, she saw bullet impacts in the wall, each wide from where she now stood. Strong enough to shatter stone and deflect or, maybe, absorb gunshots while in process… whatever it was, fighting it was a bad way to go. Little other evidence though: no shell casings, no bullets in the wall, and hardly any blood.

Hardly, but not none. There were spots here and there. There must have been a lot of it. Illapa scraped up some with her knife and dragged it across the rim of a little field sample vial, which she tucked into a pocket. She laid down flat on her stomach and looked left and right. Clean up crews are lazy, and if they can’t see it—and there it was, under one of the litters was a little chunk of something iridescent. Now what was this then? Beetle-shell looking, it was half the size of her palm. Into a pocket it went as well.

Here we are, the personal craft. Each was nearly a work of art, hand-built by the finest shops around the world. An average Koryo citizen could save their base wage for ten years and not buy one of these. Illapa ran her hand along several, the curve of the metal, the line of the leather of the seat, the arc of the handles. Such craftsmanship! Bright, curvaceous; rolling works of art. But none matched the hewn key.

When she saw it, she gasped. Beautiful, black, as if it had been carved from outer space. She hesitated to touch it, as if it would strike out. Its body was crystalline and chitinous. Ah, I wonder… She took out the found black shard of armor. Though battered by years of use, great scuffs down the side, and dings here and there, the moto was whole. Something else had lost this bit of shell.

There was, she realized, a single button on the fob. With a wince, she pushed it. A little hatch on the side popped open, revealing a slot in the body of the bike. A slot just precisely the size of the aluminum case she carried. She slid it into place closed the hatch, which sealed without a seam.

Throwing her leg over the bike, she got a feel for the handles, the weight of it as she raised the kickstand and tilted side to side between her bracing thighs. She turned the key, letting the electric engine spin up to a hum, low and bass. Oh this would be a delight, she thought, grinning. When the indicators were green she, with the gentlest of twists of the throttle, glided up to the entrance like a shadow. At the edge of the garage, she surveilled the exit. Two guards faced inwards, likely there to keep Ryong at her post as anything else. Ok, Sifu, let’s see what your toy here has got. She gunned it.

Illapa was no stranger to high-powered custom government military motos. Purpose built, proprietary, prototype—all overpowered, loaded to bear with gadgets, half-ready to explode. Every super sports moto, every luxury ride, she had put through its paces and ridden on just the back tire till they stopped accelerating. And still the force of the black moto’s acceleration caught her off guard. She nearly hamstered the thing, feeling that vertiginous moment where one’s center of gravity is absolutely in the wrong place, before correcting and setting the front tire down with a chirp. Well that’s no fun. She revved again and went roaring down the palace promenade on the back wheel all the way to the main gate, which, everyone was as startled as she to find, someone had failed to close.

One of the guards, fumbling with his gun, decided to let duty get the better of him and stepped into her path, hand out shouting stop. What a gift, she would keep her promise to Ryong twice over. Her fist connected just below his nose, the full speed and force of the moto behind it, lifting him off his feet and sending his body spinning end-over-end into the trimmed topiary beyond. A single pathetic burst of gun fire rang out from the second guard, well after she had rounded the corner out of sight.

In fifty years of spy craft, never had she had so much fun bringing a piece of evidence to headquarters. Gods, she thought, I love my job!
