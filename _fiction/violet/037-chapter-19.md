“Do you have stims?” Advika yelled to the nearest security guard over the screams of the Vizier and consort.

“Are you mad? What was that thing?” the guard shouted, his shaking hands attempting to hold the gun’s aim on Advika.

“Captain!” The Viceroy snapped, “Now!”

He tossed an auto-syringe to Advika. In a single motion she caught and injected it into her thigh. Her pupils dilated, her mind cleared; the weight, pain, and fatigue of age were. A sensation of physical silence, like closing a door against a storm.

The thing roared outside, smashing into the weave and firing in bursts, looking for weak spots.

“Good gods Advika what is that?” The Vizier drew up her robes to run.

Screams from far down the hall.

“Ogumo,” said Advika, adrenaline quaver in her voice.

“What?” Asked Hye, terrified and baffled.

“War-relic soldiers. Death machines. One worth a platoon. Everyone stay close. They do not operate alone. There will be others, probably down the halls, pincer move. You must be the target, Viceroy. Wait!”

Two guards, seasoned and dutiful, were halfway out the door before Advika could stop them. Both pulled themselves back as bullets shredded the door frame. Crouched low, Advika ran to the door, posting up next to the guards.

“We want the royals!” Came an approaching voice down the hall.

Ah, so that’s where you are, thought Advika.

She pointed to herself then to each guard, held up an open hand, and began dropping fingers in a count down. As her fist closed she whipped into the hall, crouched and firing. The guards followed, but there was little left to see. 

They dragged the heavily armored corpses back into the room. The consort and Vizier were screaming and crying, the guards shaking, visibly upset and out of their depth. Advika began stripping one and instructed the guards to do the same. She pulled off the helmet and bulletproof vest. The patches weren’t from any nation—mercenaries. She raked brains out of the inside of the helmet with her hand and placed it on the Viceroy’s head, then strapped her into the vest. The heavy, utilitarian thing was an odd contrast over royal silk robes. Hye and Sun joined the guards stripping the attackers. Hye brought the second helmet to the Vizier, who was attempting to wipe away tears.

“Why is this happening?” Daewoo whimpered.

“I don’t know,” said Hye, clipping the strap under the Vizier’s chin, tightening the strap and checking the snugness of the vest, “but we’re not dead yet.”

“You need this vest,” said Daewoo, coming to her senses, and began attempting to unclip it.

“No,” said Advika while pulling on the pants and jacket of one of the mercs. “No Eun, no. They want the girls. Alive. Why I don’t know, but they didn’t expect any resistance. You don’t announce to anyone you’re attempt to kill. They were expecting an ogumo, not me. That was the last time we’ll have the element of surprise. They haven’t switched channels yet”—she pointed her ear, in which was the earpiece to a small radio clipped to her arm, “but there’s a lot of chatter. They know something is wrong.” 

“Hye, Sun, get the pistols off the mercs. You’re trained for this.” She clipped the last ammo belt over her chest like a bandolier. “We need to leave now.”

Advika moved into the hall, swept it, and, indicating the clear, gestured for the rest to follow. She lead, with Sun behind her, the Viceroy, Vizier and consort clustered in the center, Hye behind, and the guards doing their best to cover the sides and rear. Lightning flashed. Rain pounded the windows. Far off gunfire and terrified screams told them which way not to go. 

Advika pulled them into a small gallery room. Priceless statues, ceramics, and art sat like held breath. With desperate caution, Sun pulled the door shut.

“They’ve switched channels,” said Advika, “they now know. We must get out of here. We’re going to the garage. I believe they want to take the Viceroy and girls alive, but we must not bet on that. They may simply want to kill us all and be quite sure of it.”

“This cannot be happening,” said the Vizier, “no one has attempted a coup or assassination of this magnitude in fifty years.”

“Eun, look at me,” said Advika, “this *is *happening. Worse, they have an ogumo. Maybe two. Those aren’t supposed to *exist* anymore.”

“So we make our stand,” said the Viceroy, puffing herself up, “the Joseon do not tolerate intimidation.”

“A noble thought, your grace. But we cannot win this fight. Even with my old…,” Advika paused, adjusting her phrasing, “even with the best gear and me fifty years younger, and ten times this many guards we would barely have a chance against a lone ogumo. But, there are likely a dozen mercenaries out there, and where there is one ogumo, there are usually at least two more. We must escape. The garage.”

The route was disturbingly indirect. Built on the mountainside, their location in the palace required going down three levels and through a winding set of hallways.

“There is a second way,” said the Viceroy, “there are secret passages all throughout the palace, for precisely such a situation. Two rooms over, I believe, there is a secret stairwell which leads—“

Advika snapped up a fist.

Cautious footfalls, whispered orders, and flashlight glare filtered through the shoji-style paper on the patterned sliding door. The old Sifu pointed the guards and girls into position. Hye’s eyes were wide, she shook, but her form was perfect. You trained them, Advika, she told herself, they will make it.

A shadow passed in front of the door and Advika exploded through it, firing two rounds just under the mercenary’s right ear, shredding the brain, leaving Advika with the now limp body as a shield. Gunfire erupted, bullets thudding into the dead mercenary’s armor. Advika charged, driving forward and forcing the attacker into a hurried defense.

“Go!” She screamed.

Hye rolled into the hallway, confirmed none behind, then waved the rest out. They ran down the hall, away from the mercenary’s frenzied gunfire. A rain of shredded paint and wood chips fell from the ceiling. Barely stifling screams and sobs, the Viceroy led them to the special room. Advika dropped back to follow, still holding the shredded corpse. At the door, the two guards took turns firing bursts down the hall, keeping the mercenary, who was now shouting into her radio, pinned down.

With hurried calm, the Viceroy moved to a few objects in the room. Another gallery, though dustier and the pieces lacking the allure of others. The logic of why was now becoming obvious. With a click, a panel in the wall swung back, revealing a narrow stone staircase.

Advika waved a guard to go down first. Even hidden passages could be compromised, to put the Viceroy first was foolish.

Behind them, a burst of explosions as bullets ripped through the doorway and a few pieces of ‘art.’ The guard on the left flank of the door lay dead. Advika shoved the Viceroy and Vizier down the stairs, and was about to grab the consort but she was no longer standing where she had been. She was bent over the mercenary’s body, pulling off the assault rifle and helmet.

The remaining guard was firing bust after burst until a second wave of gunfire shredded the doorway and she fell. “Hye! Sun! Now!” Advika all but threw them down the stairs after the vizier. She screamed at the consort, but she just looked up, terror in her eyes as she pulled a grenade off the body. She pulled the pin and gripped it, holding the lever closed. With dread and something resembling pride, she nodded, turned, and ran into the hallway, rifle already firing. Advika stepped onto the stairs and pulled the door shut behind them.

Muffled gunfire, followed as they rounded the flights of stone stairs; then a muted explosion.

Hardly more than shoulder’s width, unadorned raw stone stairwell was carved through the mountain’s bedrock. Through whispers and surmises, the Viceroy shared what she had remembered. Only she and the Head of Security, and previous Viceroys knew where the paths lead.  A hushed debate ensued, attempting to figure out where they were and where they would come out. The end of the path dumped them out into the woods on the side of the mountain. If the head of security had been compromised, death could be waiting at that exit. The festival hall, they decided, closest to the garage, would be their best chance.

At the juncture, they turned from the downward stairs and toward what they hoped would be as the Viceroy remembered. They came to a wall and hushed to silence, the guard leaned against it. For agonizing seconds, only the damp drip of the cold stone could be heard. The guard nodded and, with desperate care, opened the latch. There was a click and the door shifted inward, then slid aside. The roar of rain and crack of thunder returned as the cavernous, empty ballroom of the festival hall was revealed. Decorations for the Selection commencement were already half hung, tables and chairs brought out, still covered and yet to be arranged. It smelled of polishing oils and the tens of thousands of candles and sticks of incense that saturated the wood beams and arches of the beautiful ceiling.

The guard stepped through the door and having swept the space, ushered the rest through. Advika returned to point and moved cautiously through the space, with Sun just behind her along with the Vizier and Viceroy. Hye nodded to the guard to close the door and followed.

Instead of a click, Hye heard a crunching sound and a deep triple thud, thud, thud. She turned to see a nightmare. Emerging from the doorway of the tunnel looked like a spider carved from liquid night. It stood to full height, lifting the guard kicking and screaming into the air before surgically stabbing her at the base of the skull. In an instant the guard was silent and limp, body thrown aside in almost the same motion. The ogumo reached for Hye and, in a burst of insane instinct, she leaped towards it, firing round after round into the thing’s face. Twisting mid-air, she planted her feet on its chest, then launched herself backwards off the beast. Gods it was strong. Like jumping off of a tree. She was still firing as Advika came hurtling past.

The ogumo was only stunned, but that was enough. Advika found a soft exposed armpit and fired. It grabbed and threw her, but that arm now hanging raggedly and useless. Three to go.

“Run!” 

Sun grabbed the wrists of the Vizier and Viceroy and dragged them away, sprinting. Hye turned, dropped to a knee and fired two more bursts, the bullets ricocheting off the thing’s glossy armor into the ornate wood and tile behind.

The Sifu landed in a roll and was springing again. The thing ran towards Hye, remaining good upper arm outstretched, while the mid-arms fired at her, the old assailant. It’s still trying to capture, not kill. 

“Hye! Run! Now!” Advika yelled as she latched onto the ogumo from behind. One of its arms reached around and grabbed her, pulling her around in front and slamming a gun to her chest. She batted it away as it fired, rotating her whole body up to cling to its arm as she, in turn, fired down the length. 

“Protect your sister! Go!”

Hye watched the ogumo smashed her old tutor against one wall then the other before hurling her through a pile of chairs. She ran, fighting tears as gunfire faded behind her. She soon caught the rest, all three turning in terror at the sound of her approach, then relief upon recognition, followed by despair at her solitary condition.

“Where is Sifu?” Sun asked, frantic.

Hye shook her head, wiping away tears, her face set.

“We have got to move.”

Carved into the mountain alongside the Festival Hall, the garage was a huge stone vault that held royal transports and those of any visiting guests. Dozens of auto-carriages and motos, of all levels of luxury and purpose sat dutifully. Among them, Advika’s black moto, sitting half-obscured in a pool of shadow. Near the exit there was a litter. Not quite an auto-carriage, a litter was a small enclosed gondola, with two facing bench seats, pulled by a moto.

“Get in to this one! It’s ready to go,” said Sun, “Hye get in with them, I can drive.”

Hye was already pulling a helmet off the rack, which she tossed to Sun.

A litter was not the ideal option but it solved several problems, the largest being that had space and Sun knew how to pilot the moto. Autos were either cumbersomely huge or one-person powerhouse playthings. Neither suited their needs now. Hye throw the litter doors open and pulled Daewoo and the Viceroy with her into the carriage. Sun jumped onto the moto and started it, electric and gas engines coming to life. At the depression of a button on the moto handle, the garage doors began their slow grind open. Sounds of storm’s boom and roar flooded in.

Over this din came a second, more horrific sound—a door smashing open. 

At the entry from the festival hall to the garage was the ogumo, battered and furious. Sun turned in the seat and fired her pistol as it sprinted towards her. The bullets glanced off its armor like gnats. Without breaking stride it lifted her bodily off the moto and hurdled towards the yawning exit of the garage. Sun was still screaming as it carried her out into the storm. 

Over in seconds, Hye screamed her sister’s name and half fell out of the carriage onto her hands and knees. There she stayed, too stunned to even move.

From the corner of her eye, another figure appeared. She drew her pistol, furious and screaming. Finger half depressed on the trigger, she gasped and dropped the weapon to her side, running to embrace her Sifu. Advika, bloody and limping, she ran over to the litter.

“It took her!” Hye screamed, “it took her!”

Advika, bloodied face set, put her hands on Hye’s shoulders, gripping them.

“If we survive this. We will get her back. I promise. But we must survive. The ogumo will return. Get in, let’s go.”

Hye, shaking, climbed back into the litter with the Daewoo and In-yeong, both hunkered and hunched in their heavy, ill-fitting mercenary armor. Advika closed the door to the carriage, achingly got on the moto, revved the engine, and drove towards the exit. Building speed, she braced, there was no telling what was beyond that door.

The moto and its trailing litter leaped out of the garage into the wall of pouring rain. Behind her, a terrible noise came from the litter. The other ogumo. Mangled and menacing, its black form stood astride the carriage like a revenant.

Gunshots ripped up through the roof. Whatever was up there shouldn’t be. Advika cursed, unable to fire on the thing and drive in the torrential rain, unable to slow down for fear of losing the any little advantage in escaping. Desperate, she whipped the handlebars hard left, then right, tilting the carriage on two wheels, the tow bars threatening to wrench the moto itself over. Unperturbed, the ogumo held tight. It bellowed and, in a single sweep of its arm, ripped the carriage door open.

Wind roared into the carriage as Hye fired desperately into the roof. A strobe of lighting. The mountain forest whipped by behind a stinging curtain of rain. The ogumo’s horrible head, like a demonic mantis carved out of polished tar, appeared. Screaming, Daewoo fired wildly at the assailant, her pointless efforts enraging it. Two vice-like claws grab her vest, tearing through the bulletproof weave and into her chest, then hurled her out of the litter, her scream cut short by the sickening thunk of her body slamming into a roadside tree.

Emboldened, the monstrous thing crawled in, arms and legs bracing against the Sifu’s attempts to shake it. Bullets glanced off it. With a long terrible arm it reached for Hye. She reared back both feet and kicked the ogumo fully in the head. The impact rocked the litter. Miraculously, its grip on door frame came loose, sending it swinging wide out to the side of the litter. Taking advantage, Advika veered half off the road, smashing the thing into a pair of trees. It screamed with fury and pain, but held on bending the carriage frame with effort.

Seeing an opportunity, the Viceroy herself placed her pistol on the thing’s still gripping hand and fired. Finger after finger unhooked from the twisted metal with each shot.

“Yes!” Screamed Hye. “That’s working!”

One more shot. 

Then it was there again, filling the door frame, somehow having whipped itself back into place. Chunks of armor were missing, the ruined human being beneath visible, deformed and raw.

Without hesitation, it reached in and grabbed the Viceroy, pulling her face close to its, before gripping her tight in one mid-arm. It held her there without effort, the most powerful woman in Koryo powerless to save herself. The stinging rain flattened her hair and the roar of the wind and rain drowned her screams.

Hye couldn’t shoot and risk hitting the Viceroy. The ogumo was reaching for her. Manic, she grabbed its hand, wrestling with it, twisting it. God the strength of the thing.

“Hyeon!” The Viceroy screamed, holding up two hands. In each, a grenade, pins pulled. 

“Kick!”

She froze, horrified. No. 

Yet in that instant, the Viceroy looked entirely at peace with the universe, as though some great set of plans had fallen into place. She caught Hye’s eye, smiled, and released the grenade levers.

“Hyeon! Now!”

Hye braced, pushing the emotion away, and kicked hard. The ogumo, reaching, was only half holding on, now scrabbled for a grip. Missing, it fell backwards and away from the litter as both grenades exploded. A wave of orange-white heat and force slammed her into the far side before lifting the entire litter sideways, rolling it and the moto together end over end.

Pain.

Ringing. The crackle of fire and grinding of wreckage.

Rain running over her face and into her mouth.

Her name, called out from the other side of the darkness.

The taste of blood, the smell of burnt metal.

A hand on her wrist.

Her body screaming as it is dragged against gravity, against the ragged edges of pain with dull knives for teeth, into the rain and then onto the flat, cold, wet slick of pavement.

“Hye!”

Advika’s voice.

“Hyeon!”

She opened her eyes. Her Sifu—blood caked and drenched—their noses all but touching, her purple eyes softening at the sign of life they had so desperately sought.

Pain and determination blurred the stumble back down the road to the moto. Banged up, but functional.

The Viceroy. Daewoo. Hye let herself look back.

A shadow half veiled in storm, angry and limping, approached.  Awful retching sounds— suffering, rage, and death rattle in one—came with it.

The moto’s engine revved behind her.

“Hyeon!”

“Daewoo. Sun.”

“Hyeon they are *gone*.”

The thing twitched and shuttered, its outline clearer as it shambled closer.

Advika was there, hand on Hye’s shoulder.

“Hye,” she said, in a whisper almost inaudible over the rain and stepping in front of her, “They are gone. We must go. Don’t let them die for nothing.”

With empty movement, she followed her tutor, the woman who raised her, now the only thing she had left resembling home in the world, back to the moto.

The engine roared over the rain and thunder. Together, Ward and Sifu drove off into the furious storm. Death was still behind them, but for the moment, unable to follow.
