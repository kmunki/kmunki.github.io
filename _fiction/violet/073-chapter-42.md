Excitement, electric in her finger tips, tingled through Hideyo as she entered the codes to unlock the reliquary vault. The heavy door sung open, silent and smooth. At the entrance, she bowed, then stood, luxuriating in the silence and power of her feretory. The walls, floor, and ceiling, were paneled velvety black. Rows of pedestals, each topped with an item encased in a display, appeared spotlights faded on, each recessed, casting the faintest of beams. The effect was of dim pillars, free floating in the void. Her steps, mere whispers even on marble, were obliterated in here. The quiet and dark served a double purpose: protect that which was sensitive, and highlight that which must be revered: war-relics.

Not merely that, though, but those of singular rarity. Each unique, their cousin technologies and concepts lost, leaving only an island of reality as proof they ever existed at all. Within each pedestal were records: what was known of the item, of its usage and tolerances, where it was found, who may have built it, and those who may know more about it, at Violet or otherwise. A placard summarized. Some cases were only blue prints and photos, schematics and prototypes. Others were empty, waiting, space held by some preserved document or letter *describing *what was yet to be found. Upon discovery items were measured and documented, then, best as was possible, a replica, piece by piece, was attempted. Largely these failed, some essential detail hidden within or misunderstood. The remaining discoveries would be through action. Some of Hideyo’s own, what she euphemistically preferred to refer to as *experiments*, despite Okafor’s protests, had resulted  reports of such technological fecundity that even the scientist couldn’t dismiss their value. The ogumo alone, once a broken shell on one of these very pillars, had spawned what Miriam suspected might be an entirely new product line. To understand a relic, one must be bold enough to use it.

Reveling in choice, she perused her options. Each pillar glowed brighter as she approached, fading as she moved on. How rare it was to have one’s enemies sent into a trap of another’s creation. The shape of it was not hers, but the trigger and the teeth were hers to craft. She could not waste it. Too poor a bar. Raise it, Hideyo. She would savor it. She would absolutely wallow.

Her little cuckoo had been warned, messages over mesh should beat the Sifu and Ward by hours. Thrillingly close to failure. He understood now, though, to trust, to believe, to *obey*. 

The question, the puzzle, was not how to separate the Sifu from the Ward, but how to destroy the old woman permanently, unquestionably, and give space to correct the error from her first attempt. Would the Child, if she knew, leave her savior willingly? She must see her for what she is, as I did, thought Hideyo. Not as a person, not as a rearer—even one so naive can see through those pasteboard masks through to the reality: a killer, a monster. To bet on such a break was too big a risk. Besides, her vengeance would not be quiet or tidy. She gripped her pale wrist, the thin chitin flexing under pressure as she massaged the synthetic palm. No, death would not be enough: only obliteration, annihilation, an utter undoing of any graces gained.

Passing down each aisle of items, she was patient. A solution would present itself, for the first problem or the second, but never both. No it required a kind of … harmony; a brutal ballet.

Then she saw it: a vial, tiny, the liquid inside an opaque, severe bile-yellow. Placard perused, confirming each detail. *Yes, this*. As with ikebana, one must not over compose, it is the balance of the elements, their mutual tension, their difference and asymmetry creating a coherent whole. She had her elements, the vessel, the location, but it would be this lovely tincture, this evil little gem, around which it was all arranged. Revenge would be symphonic, victory operatic.

Cuckoo, you have to merely deliver your lines. Child, you must only demand what you want. I shall handle the rest.

She removed the vial from its case and held it to the light, gleaming.

Ah, Sifu, I am coming for you.
