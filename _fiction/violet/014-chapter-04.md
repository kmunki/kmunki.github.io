Warm jungle air wafted through the night. Here in humanity’s original latitude, the barest of effort was needed for any manner of living thing to thrive. Greens of every shade, thickness, and texture coated the island. Home as this little biological miracle was to an almost uncountable variety of life, it was also home to the mind and heart of one of humanity’s favorite super-organisms: the corporation. This one in particular, Violet, was built by climbing the rungs of DNA. For the right price, Violet’s products put nature in her place for a while. And tonight they were celebrating their independence.

Brand was here because the price was, for many of the world’s governments, becoming too high. Violet had, just hours before, declared itself a Sovereignty, an independent nation-state, recognized by all the players who mattered. A new form of government with citizen-employees. The bland corporate combo title of “President and CEO” took on an ironic twist. His mission: learn what you can. Something about Violet was bigger than just a new type of nation. More than even his superiors, Brand found this new truth unnerving. He had seen the Queen bend a knee to the Samraat, her Imperial Majesty of Kerala, but that at least made sense. This way was anarchy.

 He took a long pull on his cigar, letting the smoke swirl around under his tongue and out through his teeth; the ephemeral tendril floated out over the inky green jungle canopy. The party was held on Violet’s massive elevated platform. Acres wide, it just inches above the dense canopy, which itself was nearly thirty meters off the ground. Behind him, the party goers were clustered together talking and dancing. Beyond, the Headquarters themselves, three huge concrete disks embedded in the mountainside. Violet was one great connected campus. From here he could get wherever he wanted on the island. Though it wasn’t entirely clear where it was he would need to go.

The music quieted and the lights calmed. White spot lights lit the stage.

A murmur of excitement rippled through the crowd as a woman walked onto stage. Miriam Okafor, Chief Scientist. He had seen her among the party guests. Away from the thrum of the dance floor and the strobe of the lights, individuals and little clusters of people came to pay tribute. She had been relaxed, perhaps even delighted, that they would come to exchange pleasantries. She was West African, Yoruba from her accent. Her laugh was rich and real. At a compliment she waived it off, touched a hand to a shoulder. A humility not of face but of heart. She did not see her own power. Even now, on stage, it radiated off of her in coruscating waves that rippled through the party, into the thick jungle, over the white sands, and out into the crystal dark sea.

“Welcome!” She began, beaming, “welcome honored guests, dear friends and allies, and, of course, *fellow citizens*, to Violet’s Sovereignty Day celebration!”

As she spoke tight ringlets of shoulder length hair bounced and danced. My god she is striking, thought Brand, but practiced in a way that indicated it was always at the bottom of the to do list. She wore a yellow dress that all but glowed next to her dark, smooth skin. Draped over her arm, her white lab coat. He noticed a security badge thoughtlessly dangled from it.

“What an amazing evening. It has been a true pleasure to be surrounded by all of you on this special night. Thankfully, for you and me, I’ll only be up here a moment. I have the great honor of introducing the woman who brought us all together. The founder of Violet, our CEO through the good times and the bad, and now the President of our new nation, Dr. Wen ‘Li Xing’ Xiang!”

Onto the stage rolled Li Xing. Brand had seen both of their dossiers a dozen times, had them all but memorized. Where Miriam was striking, Li Xing was gravitational. She was tall and lithe, wearing a brilliant, colorful designer suit. Behind her, huge screens projected her image so that, even at his remove, Brand could see the crystalline intensity and intelligence in her eyes. Her chair had been raised, so she sat eye-to-eye with the standing Okafor as the two embraced. In that way of politicians, they whispered in one another’s ear before separating, exerting power with a moment of privacy in the glaring public eye. 

Okafor waived to the crowd as she walked off stage still smiling, looking back over her shoulder at Li Xing. As she descended the stairs, to Brand she seemed to transform, from titan of industry back to, for a moment, a woman who wanted more than anything to get back to her research. Her gaze lingered on a door. Following the line of sight, Brand realized from there a set of offices nestled among the canopy led to the great disks of Violet headquarters embedded in the mountain. It appears, thought Brand, *that *is where I need to go.

Li Xing waited, silent, for the crowd to quiet. The wild sounds of the island—wind through branches, waves on the sand, croaks and chirps of jungle life—replaced those of civilization. As it did, she remained still, listening, her face serene.

“Progress,” she began, “is why we are here. We—we, the people of Violet—we think of tomorrow.

Today, though, we celebrate. Today something momentous has happened. Today we gather, we commune, we bond. But it is not because of yesterday. It is not even, because of today. No, today, we are celebrating Tomorrow.

Tomorrow will be like yesterday. We will return to our labs, our factories, our offices. We will continue our work, building and bettering the things that make our world a livable place. We build the wombs where new lives grow, we build the blood that saves lives threatened, we build the drugs that lets lives be better, longer. 

Tomorrow will not be like yesterday. Tomorrow, we will the first dawn will rise on the nation of Violet.”

Applause, cheers and whoops of approval exploded from the crowd. Li Xing, smiling, held her hands up, asking for quiet. She began to move across the stage as she spoke.

“Tomorrow, a new era for humanity begins.

We are still so young. So new.

The Long War all but obliterated our shared sense human history. Our world is still stumbling around in shadow, attempting to see which shattered pieces belong together, squabbling over ashes and rubble. This world is a graveyard of better worlds and failed futures, haunting us like ghosts. 	Yet we—we, the people of Violet—we have *built *something. Something wonderful. To many, something almost miraculous.

It’s been said that ‘ideas can come from anywhere, from anyone.’ In truth, they cannot. We all know this. What we mean, but fear to admit, is that *we do not know where genius comes from*. 

Progress is similar. Mystical. Emergent. 

Misunderstood.

Progress is not a series of discoveries. Progress does not merely happen.

The future, so often synonymous with progress, is not a thing, somewhere, waiting to be unearthed. It is only a place, a dimension of space time. The fourth, built into the very fabric of the universe. It comes into being without effort. Time passes. 

For the first ten thousand millennia of hominid existence, our future and past were indistinguishable. Existence cycled, unchanging, a great static motion.

Then came fire, and with it, the fifth dimension.

Progress—the human dimension.

Tomorrow will come whether we act or not. But if we decide, if we act, if we strive, tomorrow can be *better *than yesterday*.*

This is humanity’s gift to the universe.

We are in a strange moment, my friends. The nations of the world have stopped striving. They hide, in their cities, safe from the Wilds, keeping the peace. Yet they progress, no? It is a mirage. War-relics have made the metaphor real—these fools believe they can dig up tomorrow, find the future fossilized in some forgotten cave.

We—we, the people of Violet—we know better. 

We—we, the people of Violet—are not content to remain stationary, to live off the scraps of the past. 

We—we, the people of *Violet*—will seize our lucky destiny!”

The crowd roared with furious approval. Brand, almost among them, was rapt, stunned.

Li Xing smiled.

“The Long War is the rarest of gifts: a map of progress. Where we can go, where traps and treasures lie. Together we will be able to create something none could alone. Our ideas *need* one another. Enzyme and catalyst, inert in isolation, energetic when combined. *That *is the purpose of Violet.

Through all of history, nations formed from tribes, turning shared racial, religious, or regional identity into safety, into unity, into power. We are not brought together by anything so base. We are here for one reason: *progress*.

Whether we will it or not, tomorrow will come.

But, because we—we, the people of Violet—because *we* *will it*,* *tomorrow will be *better.*”

“Good evening, Dr. Okafor,” he began, his accent and eyes charming, “everyone else has had their chance with you, I was hoping it could be my turn.”

She turned from looking out over the jungle. During Li Xing’s speech she had made her way out to the platform edge, to lean against the rail and watch at a remove.

“But,” he added, “if you’re looking for solitude, I won’t intrude.” 

That laugh again, an edge of disbelief this time in her voice, “No. I’m just getting some air,” Okafor gave him a raised eyebrow, “And you are?”

“Brand,” he grinned, “Jack Brand.” He raised his glass to hers, “Congratulations are in order. Earlier this year, first company on the planet to a trillion in market cap. Now the first company to declare Sovereignty and get it to stick for more than ten minutes. Dr. Wen up there gets to make the speeches, but my impression is that it’s because this woman in front me understands life almost as well as the gods or even genes themselves. Cheers!”

A flicker of satisfaction and pride before the requisite bashfulness. She clinked all the same.

Li Xing and Okafor hadn’t started the bio-revolution, Brand knew, but they managed to turn what was left of the empty, shattered world after the Long War and rebuild the basics of what it meant to be human. Diseases were gone because she had decided to eliminate them. Brand felt himself being swept up in the current. A one in a billion mind that could conceive, create, and commercialize. And at Violet there were two of them. Li Xing’s greatest coup had not been Violet itself but turning the person who should have been her biggest enemy into her ally. Their lives were balanced and entwined, spiraling upwards in their own double helix. Li Xing ran the show and Miriam was the star magician, pulling cures for cancer and aging itself out of her hat. 

He caught himself staring. You’re not here for the party, old boy. Find out what they’re up to. What she’s up to. Her badge could show him.

He manifested a rakish grin, “My I’ve heard so much about you!” He feigned the tone of a random untouchable, who would look at her admiringly from the cover of a magazine, “Autograph?”

She laughed and rolled her eyes, “Yes, so many people want the autograph of the biggest nerd at a Giant Evil Corporation,” her tone put scare quotes around that last bit. He feigned shock. “Please,” she said, dismissive, “not everyone in the audience loved that speech. You don’t look like the rabble either. What did you say it was you did again? Not that I expect an answer after you dodged the first question about being here. On an island a half-day’s cruise from anywhere, party crashers aren’t exactly something we’ve gotten used to.”

Brand pressed his palms together, “Ah, yes. You have me. Want to know the truth of it, I imagine?” He dropped his voice, “I can tell you.” Quieter still, she leaned in, “just the two of us, eh?” She could feel his breath on her ear and put one arm around, the center of her back, pulling her in close. “I’m a *shade*.” He said, the laugh barely repressed under his voice. He squeezed her close, her arm draped with the white jacket pressing between them. She pushed him away, playfully.

“Oh stop. Alright so don’t tell me. If you’re some bored dignitary husband flirting with me, let me enjoy it. Don’t go and make me think the whole thing is a farce with the far flung fantasy.” She paused for a moment, “You’re too handsome. And what’s that accent, European? Cute, but no.”

Brand winced, for a millisecond, and let his laugh join hers. Forced at first, but stumbling into the real as he thought of how odd it was the truth was the best cover of all.

“Well then I guess I’ll leave you guessing. It was a pleasure, Dr. Okafor,” he said, leaving her with a wink and a smile.

He followed a waiter across the party to what looked like the closest entrance to the main building and there, stopping him, begged, “Do you, ah, have a private bathroom? Something isn’t sitting quite right and I’d prefer not to disturb everyone else. Are you following?”

“Of course, xiansheng,” the waiter nodded for Brand to follow and badged them through one of the doors and lead him down a hallway. Once they were out of sight, the waiter was dealt with and Brand took the waiters badge as far as it would go. Now for Okafor’s. When the door badged for hers only, well now he was getting somewhere.
