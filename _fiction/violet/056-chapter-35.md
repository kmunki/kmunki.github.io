What had seemed like a single office was, in fact, one of perhaps a dozen entry ways into the ten story block of the tower that comprised The Blade’s Nairobi branch. Sidaya, narrating, walked Illapa first past training grounds, where mercenaries went from, as she put it, “slap-dash soldiers of fortune to women of discipline, focus, and efficiency. This is not so much a matter of honor. That’s a vestige of a time where soldiers had to be compelled to fight. I forget, your military is conscript, no?”

“It is,” said Illapa, “but only for the broodlings identified as appropriate.”

“How fascinating! We assume none of that. Honor and glory lead to strange decision making. You might seek to win a battle that will lose a war. Revenge, sacrifice, all of these useless concepts perversely incentivize all manner of stupidity. Yet I have not seen that, not broadly, from Inkan troops. You may be on to something there! For us it is simply a profession. We are paid by objectives met. You want someone dead? We accept a small retainer as a show of good faith and then escrow the correct funds with one of a half dozen trusted third-parties. They are disbursed upon external evaluation of the objective’s satisfaction.”

“Like a bounty.”

“Precisely like a bounty,” she said, as they passed the firing range. Some students were moving through an ersatz urban environment of plywood and pop-up targets, switching weapons rapidly as conditions varied. “What an elegant mechanism for achieving a goal. Part of our skill set is, of course, *evaluating *said bounties and, should they be too low, informing the issuer as such. You see here, on this course, some are motivated by a desire for self-improvement, to be sure, but we also have a series of rewards for best time, best accuracy, most improved, so on and so forth, each month. Better still, our mercenaries learn from each other and the coach receives a portion of the winnings.”

“Seems you’ve got it cracked. Put the coin in the purse for the right reasons at the right intervals, and you get what you want.”

“Ah! Excellent. This is not so. It is an important part of the equation. But this is what I wanted to show you!”

Illapa had noticed that as they walked away from the firing range, their path had become louder, not quieter. A persistent roar, that pulsed in waves, seemed to come from down the hall, along with the low muffled thump-thump of far off music. She assumed some kind of shared wall, then realized they were *approaching *the sounds. The roar was that of a crowd. The music would be interrupted by what she increasingly realized was an announcer of some kind.

Sadiya approached a guarded door and, as she did, the guard stepped aside, opening the door. A deafening cacophony of thundering music, fanatic crowds, and animalistic sounds met them, along with strobing lights and the sight of a small sea of bodies below. Box seats, Illapa realized, above some kind of arena. A small one, with dense tiered seating around a central raised dohyo. In the ring were mercenaries, circling one another. Both were bloodied, exhausted. Illapa had seen competitive matches before. She found it boring. Fighters who have time to psych themselves up, who are in comfortable, loose fitting gear, where the room is well lit. Yet here the fighters were circling and, between them, was a pistol.

“Is that a gun?”

“It is,” said Sadiya, savoring the response.

One mercenary lunged, the other kicked the gun to the side and brought a knee up, missing the first’s face but grazing the ear, opening herself up for a grapple.

“It’s not a real gun, is it? Taser? Paint ball?”

“It’s a small dart with bullet ant venom. The dart can’t pierce armor and isn’t fatal. The objective is to incapacitate your opponent by any means without killing or permanently harming them. We have dozens of scenarios, this one is designed around a ‘capture, don’t kill’ rule of engagement as well as ‘no civilian casualties.’ “

“By that you mean…”

“Audience members have been shot. They’re all mercenaries, it’s good training in pain tolerance. There is a small bonus as compensation for those who are, though it’s not enough to incentivize it. It was surprisingly difficult to find an amount that was appropriate until we realized it should be a decaying scale. The chances of being shot are low enough that if it happens twice, you probably did it on purpose for the payment. So, you get half the amount every time it happens. No one has been shot twice since.”

“I suppose pain for pay is something a bit more common with your folks?”

“Oh very much so. And, ah, there we have it.”

The first mercenary had grappled the second, vicing her legs around the other’s neck, having pushed the gun to the edge of the ring.

“Why not use the gun?”

“An excellent observation! We have different victory conditions. The goal is to create a realistic scenario, where both participants can be predator or prey. In this case, if you shoot your opponent with the dart, you accept the role of prey, that is, the person we would be attempting to abduct, capture, disable, what have you. It’s a victory, true, but a much lower cash prize. Disable your opponent, particularly via knock out, and get cuffs on them, and you have a full victory. Either combatant can choose either path. Makes for some fascinating strategy.”

“Clever training,” said Illapa as the second mercenary went limp and the crowd roared.

“You seem somewhat unimpressed,” said Sadiya.

Illapa shrugged, “games are just that. Good training, but no substitute.”

The combatants left the ring, the victor walking away, the loser being carried to recover.

“I could not agree more. You’ve seen our other methods of training and encountered us in the field. No, our skills are not what I am interested in showing you, we arrived slightly early. Ah, yes, here it is.”

The announcer walked into the ring, the music quieted, as did the crowd.

“Fellow fighters! In our final fight for the evening, we have two honored guests from city-under!”

The crowd shouted and whooped, whistled and banged on seats.

“Hybrids?” Illapa asked, not moving her eyes from the ring.

The announcer continued, “Tonight’s fight is Mismatch!”

Sadiya clapped her hands together in delight.

“First, weighing in at over two-hundred kilograms, Ngrumo!”

A colossal silverback gorilla knuckled his way up onto the dohyo. He waived to the crowd, flexed, and beat his chest. The thundering sound sent the crowd into apoplexy.

“Second, weighing in at a svelte twelve kilograms, Kali!”

A lithe white-yellow serval trotted, almost pranced, onto the dohyo. She bent one knee, bowing to the crowd, then reared on her hind legs and bounced, and finally, opened her mouth and bared her needle sharp fangs to the entire room. As she did, a single gleaming drop emerged from one of the canines and dropped to the mat sending the crowd into a second set of fits.

“Fighters will circle! Place your bets!” The announcer bellowed.

“Is that serval venomous?”

“She certainly is,” said Sadiya, “an exquisite creature.”

“Strength versus speed and venom?”

“Strength and *smarts. *Both are hybridized, but as you know, if the species is already intelligent the increase is substantial. No uplift, but Ngrumo has beaten some of our dumber recruits at chess.”

A bell toned, and the fighters stopped circling, squaring up. The crowd dropped to a whisper.

“Victory,” said the announcer, “is knockout or ring-out. Understood?” She looked to the gorilla, who nodded, then to the serval, who did the same.

“Fighters ready!” The announcer backed off the dohyo, “Fight!”

For several seconds, there was little movement. The gorilla, Ngrumo, crouched slightly, spring-loading himself. Kali, the serval, hunkered in a cat-like stalking position, movements achingly slow. Ngrumo feigned a lunge, a hint of a muscle flinch, and Kali was in the air. Pure coiled energy sent her arcing through space, her entire body rotating up and around her head, tail helicoptering, such that as Ngrumo’s hand swept out to grab her, he found emptiness. At the last moment Ngrumo shifted his weight, dropping his arm and shoulder just out of range, sliding across the ring. The serval landed and the two were once again still, having replaced one another on opposite sides of the ring. The tense crowd was silent.

Sadiya stood, as if she could not tolerate the excitement, but then said, “Come on, that’s enough of that.”

Bewildered, Illapa followed her back into the corridor.

“Was the fight over?” Illapa asked.

“No, not at all. What did you think of it?”

“I think I want to know how it ended!” She said, somewhat indignant.

“Excellent. *That *is what I had hoped to show you,” Sidaya said, stepping into an elevator. She pressed the button. Illapa felt gravity increase as they ascended. “What you encountered in Koryo was a tiny part of our organization, a single team. But we are not uniform. There is no one ‘way’ we do things. We do very little in the way of direct training. What you are hiring, in effect, is not any given team, but our expertise in creating a system to match you to the right team for the job. Which, in your case, is protecting shipments, product.”

The elevator opened at one end of a single long corridor. On either side, the walls were glass. Looking out, Illapa saw a huge room, like a warehouse, with several detached train cars in various states of unloading.

“Is this part of the city-mid station?”

“It is. We have access to our shipments the moment they arrive. For this particular client, whose needs are so close to your own, we had a ‘pick-up team’ who retrieved the shipment from the original source, rode with it by sea and rail, and are now switching teams. Further the nature of the product is… sensitive, complex. And its sale may not even be its final destination, so we needed a team comfortable moving through, shall we say, extra-national conditions.”

“Our product moves through the Onzulu. You have teams that can handle that?”

Sidaya nodded yes, then tilted her head towards the window.

“Ah, I see, that’s what you were speaking to. We could do the same,” Illapa feigned thinking aloud, “ship from our factories in Inka to the Mombasa port… bring it up here, shift teams to rail specialized — is that a consideration, rail versus ship?”

“Of course. Everyone specializes in something.”

“Like ogumo?”

Sadiya stiffened, the way one does when stepping into icy water.

“I’m sorry,” she said, offering the agent an out, “I believe I misheard you.”

“You didn’t,” said Illapa, “Ogumo. Or something very much like it. In addition to the moto, it was one of my ‘discoveries’ when at the Summer Palace was a chunk of armor. Took our analysts a while to figure out just what it was, we didn’t quite believe it ourselves.”

“Ogumo no longer are made. War-relics, once yes, but none exist now.”

“So we thought!” Said Illapa, “I felt same as you. But the cells were too fresh. Suit would have been made in the last decade, no more. And your mercs are good, I’ll give you that, but the Koryo don’t slouch there either.”

“Where are you going with this?”

Illapa looked out at the train cars being loaded, considering. She then said, “Condor and Violet are in a unique struggle. Until now, it was countries that challenged one another. The first decades of the post-war Shadow were the powers testing one another, spying and skirmishing, trying to gain the edge. The First and Second Revolutions weren’t much different. The sovereign corporations, though, are something else. We, the Inka, need to win, need Condor to win. I know that won’t sway you, of course, but it’s the truth of the situation. I want to hire you precisely because of your experience working with them.”

Again, Sadiya winced.

“With whom?”

“With Violet, of course. I was not *entirely *honest in my reason for interviewing you,” said Illapa, “We believe the Ward, Hyeon Bong-Cha, and the Sifu of her and her sister Princess have gone missing. Now, my intel says they were in Pyongyang the night following the attack. The Ward was there and so, claim eye witnesses, was the Sifu, but not the princess.”

“Viceroy-elect Prince Ji-woo already has a bounty on all three.”

“And, given the nature of this situation, I can imagine The Blade has been privately offered a second, far more lucrative offer on only the Ward and Sifu. Let us offer a third.”

Sadiya scrutinized the Inkan then said, “Leave Inka. Come work for us.”

“Work for The Blade, as a mercenary?” Illapa could not keep the distain out of her voice.

“Your partnership with the Keralans and the Olokun’s spy network”—it was Illapa’s turn to wince. Sadiya grinned slightly and continued, “is hardly much different. You’re on loan! The world is changing, Agent Illapa. Nations, mighty as they are, can’t last. They are organized around accidents of chance. There is nothing magic about the dirt in which you were born, nothing tragic about that of others. Rather strange, isn’t it, that we are all expected to be so loyal to our mother country? It is not as though we can move around, trying life in a few different places. No, nations of old demand fealty regardless of merit. Demanding your service, wrapping it in the trappings of honor and duty, rather than earning and acquiring it, is unworthy of you.”

“And for that I should defect?”

“Such strong words, Agent! No no no, not defect. The Blade is not at war with Inka. We are not a nation. You, Agent, are in the employ, as I understand it, of Condor-Moray. Vassal to the Inka, no doubt, but all but sovereign. Violet, the Blade, the Onzulu, these places are competition with Condor, not mortal enemies of the Inka.”

“They sure do a lot of killing for corporations.”

Sadiya shrugged, “these are violent times. Edge-lands and Wilds have hardly receded after a century. There are civil wars, border spats, and assassinations. The questions of what a country even is… what lets one govern, be sovereign, is being re-decided now, in our life times. Look at Prince Ji-woo! Allied with Violet to achieve a near bloodless coup for both of them. Exciting, in its own way! And you!” She laughed, surprising herself with the idea. ”A critic of violence. An odd critique for someone employed as *you* are by a corporation. How often our anger at others is anger at their reflection of ourselves, eh? Alas, I cannot accept your offer on behalf of Condor, sadly, Agent Quechua. Our prior contracts, with whomever they may be, stipulate as much. By accepting the first, we can accept no further that would interfere.”

“And I will not leave Condor, nor the Inka.”

“You may still,” Sadiya said, an ironic smile forming, “but sadly I agree it will not be today.” She depressed a button on a wall. A moment later, a black cat padded into the hallway.

“Iyawa here will show you out.”

The cat stopped, sat, curled its tail around its feet, and regarded Illapa with yellow eyes.

“That easy?” Illapa asked, eyebrow raised.

Sadiya laughed, “I am no fool, Agent Quechua. You know *far *more than I would like, but you arrived that way. The chances you and only you have that information are zero. Killing you would put me in a difficult position with *several *major powers and, well then, I would have to spend far more time than I would like addressing that little matter. I do have a *company *to run, Agent. I am sorry we cannot do business. Best of luck in your hunt. You will need it, my people have a substantial head start.”

She offered a small bow, which Illapa returned.

“If you’ll excuse me, I have some business to attend to directly.”

Sadiya entered the elevator and was gone.

Illapa checked her watch, sighing, “well, I suppose it’s time to go.” She turned and took one last look at the station, tilting her watch *just so* and depressing the crown twice, then turning slightly, again.

Addressing the cat she said, “after you.”
