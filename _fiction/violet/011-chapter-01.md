Hye, royal Ward of the New Joseon Dynasty, had never quite understood her luck. Chosen from her rainy fishing village at four—by chance, the officials said, though her grandmother whispered about fate—she arrived to find another small girl already waiting. Of all the children tested, of all the villages visited, somehow it was Hye who was selected. Whether by chance or fate, she and Sun were forever arguing which it was. Only five herself, the royal-born Princess sat next to the scared, sad newcomer. Hye clung to her and, in many ways, never quite let go. Sixteen intervening years and a battalion of tutors, courses, and ceremonies later they were still a pair.

With its black-in-the-shade-green-in-the-sun tiles and conifer gardens, the Summer Palace almost glowed as golden-hour light spilled across the mountainside. Enjoying the deliciously cool autumn afternoon, Princess Sun grinned as she came around the curving stone path to find her sister balled up on a settee, elbows on knees, nose in book. 

“Fantasizing again, Hye?” Sun asked, teasing, “One of your wuxia novels? *Condor Heroes?*”

Hye let only her eyes move, looking up through her eyebrows with skepticism.

“I prefer wuxia movies and shows to books. The fights are more fun to watch than read. This” —she tapped the pages—“is history. Treasure ships. For fantasy, I have *your* selection bid.”

"Oh yes, Zheng He," Sun squeezed herself alongside her sister, "He was a eunuch, right? Not so different from a Ward. Plucked from his ordinary life into royal service—honored, but not royal. Yet not likely to rule."

“Precisely,” said Hye, “While the Emperor, princes, and *princesses *stayed home doing… well it’s so hard to say because none of it was important enough to write down. It seems Zheng He is the one in the history books, not the royals! Oh wait, I’m sorry, I’m wrong. Here,” she tapped the page archly, “they’re mentioned. Just before the last voyage. The most important thing the Xuande Emperor did was—let me check, ah yes—not get sick and die. There you have it!” Hye closed the book with gusto and then, taking on a herald’s regal tone, said “when we get you Selected and you rule Koryo as Viceroy of the New Joseon Dynasty, your most important duty is to… stay alive.”

Sun laughed, straightened to sit upright, became solemn and put her hand on her heart, “I shall do my utmost.”

“For Koryo!”

“For the New Joseon Dynasty!”

Both fell back into the chair laughing.

"Have you ever wondered though?" Hye asked, dreamy, "What would have happened if the Xuande Emperor had died then? He was *so* sick. No Eighth Voyage to the East, no Golden Coast, no Inka War!"

"What an odd thing to consider," said Sun. "'Chance is the droplet's path, not the river's,' no?"

"Proverbs? Please, tell me you aren't going to quote those when you're Viceroy."

"No, because I shall be coining them. I don't intend to be a footnote in *anyone's* story."

"Sometimes I wonder how close we came to something else. Maybe no Zheng He, no Ming Dynasty meeting the East... maybe no Long War. No Ananda to release the plagues that started it all."

"And maybe the Far Siders made it to the dark side of the moon," said Sun, leaning her head back onto her sister's shoulder. "I suspect something like the Long War would have happened no matter what. Asura Ananda, the plagues weren't special. Some other monster would have come along."

“I bet Sifu agrees with me.”

“Sifu Shidao *is* history—she’s a living textbook. Maybe she knew Ananda and we can just ask her if she thinks someone else could have done it. Zheng He, Treasure Voyages, *please*. Shouldn’t you be studying more recent history?”

Hye swatted her, “I have been! All about arcologies,” she said, “I will visit one, one day.”

“And I will rule Koryo—perhaps all the Continuum one day,” she replied, attempting to tease, but unable to be anything but earnest in that desire.

“That will be wonderful. I’ll be your ambassador and you’ll send me all over the world.”

She sighed, “Sweet sister, always looking at the sky.”

“I am not! I *was *…” she leaned over, picking up another book from the ground, “I was, ah, *visualizing. *What it must have been like to live in an arcology during the war, watching the world turn to Wilds around you.”

“While reading about treasure ships landing on the Golden East’s coast?”

“I had been testing my knowledge of *this,*” said Hye, waving a copy of Xu’s *Arcologies: A Definitive History* at her sister. “Zheng He was… a break.”

"You took a break from studying to study? Hye! All this studying and nothing on *our* strategy? We need more than history trivia to convince the Royals to vote for me. Want to be an ambassador, see the world? Help me earn the boons that prove I'm ready to rule."

"Boons like what? I know the Viceroy has to sponsor you, but what counts?"

“I know that! How is your reading about any of this ancient history useful for that?”

“Well…,” Hye hesitated, “ummm… decisions in crisis?”

“Hye! We have to focus. You can’t waste *your* time because that wastes *our* time.”

“It’s not a waste! I’m ready for any test! We could bet the Sifu for her help. She could get us a boon. I know *Arcologies*. I know it, Onzulu to Pearl. I could beat her.”

“Prove it,” said a stern, yet playful voice.

Both girls startled. Standing behind them was an old woman wrapped in simple gray silk robes and leaning on a polished staff. Her long gray hair was up with a few twists, held in place by a jade skewer. Her eyes caught Hye's attention, as they always did—that unsettling icy purple, color faded with age to something neither natural nor kind. Hye had never seen that color in anyone else. 

“Is that a formal challenge, Sifu?” Asked Hye, “I am ready!” She leaped to her feet.

Sifu Advika Shidao set her staff aside and adjusted her robes.

“We shall see how ready you are. Crane-Dragon Duel? Or are your bruises from the last time still healing?”

“If we win, a boon?” Sun asked.

“I will fight for that!” Hye bounced on the balls of her feet, removing a warming shawl revealing a more practical training gui beneath. So she *had *been practicing, Advika thought.

“I can’t grant that,” the Sifu said.

“Your help then, for a week, to ask.”

“Is that all?” Advika teased, “and should you lose? What do you offer?”

Hye grumbled, negotiating within her own mind to find an acceptable counter offer, “We, ah, we will do the…” she looked hard at the Sifu, trying to discern the old master’s desires.

“No campaigning for a week,” the Sifu offered.

“Sifu! No!” Sun begged.

The old woman was impassive.

“Sun,” said Hye, “I can win this.”

"But the Viceroy's seventh year approaches," said Sun, "Selection could be called any week! We don't know how much time."

“*You* are the one who said for a boon!”

Sun groaned.

“It’s about arcologies, Sun! I can do this, please,” now Hye was begging, “I won’t let you down.”

“OK, ok,” she held up her hands, relenting, “don’t lose.”

“Then it’s decided,” said Advika, then turning, “Ah, Vizier Daewoo, your timing is impeccable.”

Down the mountain path from the palace came Vizier Daewoo Eun, moving with the stately grace her thick-layered robes demanded. Chief advisor to the Viceroy, she wore her authority in jewels and embroidered charms—each one heavy with wealth, heavier with responsibility. Her clasped hands were tucked into long, overlapping sleeves and her tall, trapezoidal hat jangled with formal ornamentation.

“I do not have time for your games, Sifu Advika,” said the Vizier.

"Crane-Dragon Duel is hardly a game, your honor! Sifu has bet us a boon!"

"Those aren't yours to grant, Sifu Advika. Besides, girls, Prince Ji-woo's camp has already started early campaigning—you'll need more than old ritual tricks to compete with that aggression. But wait, there is a more pressing matter for the Sifu," said the Vizier, an edge in her voice.

“Oh Daewoo,” she said, “you would not have sauntered down here yourself to grace us with your presence were the matter pressing. Come now we need your expertise as well. I could not have asked for a better, more worthy judge.”

The Vizier tilted her moonlike face and blinked with curiosity, “Judge?”

“We are testing Hyeon’s claim to have mastered her arcology studies.”

Hye huffed and lowered into the fighting stance that she realized Advika had herself been holding this entire time.

“How am I to judge,” asked Vizier Daewoo, skeptical but intrigued, “Crane-Dragon hasn’t been used in ages. I appreciate the old ways being kept alive, I do, but to earn selection *this* way? One must be truly desperate. The council hasn’t honored a challenge since the First Revolutions. I’d need to consult the rules, I hardly remember how it works, no no, come—”

“We use it to practice! The game is simple, your honor, and only asks of the judge an astute ear and mind. Hence our luck at your arrival,” said Sun, shifting tone. “I am biased, for I am implicated in Hyeon’s wager. Should she win, we shall get the Sifu’s aid. Should she lose, the two of us must, ah…”

“Call off the campaign for a week,” injected the Sifu.

“Don’t worry Sun,” said Hye, “I’m ready. Trust me!”

Sun exhaled, calming herself. “So be it. Vizier,” she turned again to Daewoo, “the game itself is martial, hence their readiness to spar, and intellectual, hence our need of you. Questions are asked by an arbiter, me, during the fight. Fighters must shout readiness to reply first for the honor to answer, they are then judged on eloquence, accuracy, and brevity. A perfect response is a single poetic line that answers the heart of the question, showing the deepest understanding. These are rare. Recitation of facts is sufficient. Scoring is, unlike the rules, quite complicated. If you merely state your judgment, I shall tally the score.” 

“There is business to which we need to attend,” said the Vizier, smoothing her green and white outfit, absent-mindedly, “but as I possess both the aesthetic and scholarly skills you require, I shall deign to adjudicate this little game, if nothing else to keep the old ways alive.”

All three bowed, a hand-capped fist held to their chests. “Thank you, your honor,” said Hye.

“Fight!” Shouted Sun.

The old woman's age evaporated. What remained: decades of muscle memory, coiled and ready. Hye bounced and bobbed—excited energy against her teacher's stillness. They circled. A breeze rustled the trees.  

“First question in Crane-Dragon Duel Arcology,” Sun shouted, breaking the silence, “How many, then, now and ever?”

Advika advanced as a blur, her strike the final whip crack of a full body snap. Hye expected it and was still startled, barely batting the hand away and bouncing back to give herself room as she shouted, “Hai!”

“Hye, first response!”

“One! Hundreds! A handful!” Hye barked as she threw a series of kicks at Advika, “the first was created by accident, a panic response to the plagues. Mid-war there were over three-hundred bubble cities, though an official count was never — ugh!” She spluttered as Advika’s feigned strikes morphed into a gut-level roundhouse that Hye blocked a moment too late, forcing her to roll mid-sentence. She bounced up and continued, “With the war over, many arcologies were forgotten, lost in the Wilds, or failed and were abandoned. Many, however,” block, dodge, counter, “have remained, the precious sole sources of agar.”

“Judgment!” Shouted Sun, being perhaps more dramatic with her shouts than was strictly required because it tickled her.

“I see now,” said Daewoo, grasping the nature of the game.

She considered a moment and said, “the answer is correct. I found it poetic at the start, then polished but direct for the rest. Accuracy is high, given the inclusion of the nuances of the question. Brevity is… I am not sure how much shorter an acceptable answer would be, so I suppose acceptable until I hear more.”

Hye and Advika’s attacks had paused during the recitation of the judgement, the two once again resuming their slow circling.

“Why has the fighting stopped?” Asked Daewoo.

“It’s disrespectful to strike while the judge speaks,” said Hye, “to put the body over the mind is to lower both.”

Advika nodded with pride. “Not so barbaric, eh Daewoo?”

“Not at all. Imagine how elevated it could become without your churlishness,” the Vizier shot back. Advika laughed and looked at Sun.

“Fight! Question Two!” Sun had barely uttered the first syllable before Hye was in the air hurtling towards Advika. Daewoo had seen expert demonstrations of the Duel in the past, as it was a traditional part of several celebrations and ceremonies. But not like this. What Advika had taught these girls was something else. The speed, force, and grace were exceptional. She nearly didn’t hear the second question, and blustered.

“May we speed this up? The Viceroy—”

“The Viceroy will make her mistakes with or without you,” said Advika ducking Hye’s strikes, “for example, I still have a job.”

“The second question!” Sun reiterated, “what do I eat? What do I make?”

Hye, about to shout her readiness, found herself under a barrage of blows that were, themselves, feints to get in close enough for Advika to grapple her. The old woman's arms were iron vices—decades of muscle and discipline, not the pharmaceutical youth most royals bought. How was she this strong? Hye thought, desperate to get an arm free.

“Answer!” Advika bellowed while strangling her student. As she was about to speak, Hye launched off the ground sending two knees hurtling towards Advika’s face, forcing her to release and handspring away.

“Sifu first response!”

“Sun, wind, and earth turned to health and life,” Advika responded.

“Judgement!” Shouted Sun, barely able to repress a chuckle at her Sifu’s arrogance.

“Poetic, I grant it that,” said Daewoo. “Certainly brief. And technically correct, but barely, and incomplete. I think there is more to it than that.”

“Response!” Hye said bouncing and juking at Advika’s renewed attempts to wrestle her student.

“Hye second response!” Shouted Sun.

"From the elements, the light of the sun, breath of the wind, and heat of the earth, my meals are found. It's true! Bah!" Hye leaped over a sweep, "But waste is not allowed. My mighty stomachs, dread digesters, turn even deadly tanks of war into the elements I need to survive. Elements I eat and, thus, elements I make! And from the elements: agar—that precious substrate that lets us reshape life itself. Without it, no medicine. No engineered crops. No future." She landed, rolled. "Agar is survival!"

Daewoo clapped, “Full marks, for Ward Hyeon,” she shouted, in delight. What fun this was!

“Yes!” Shouted Sun, beaming, “I mean… Fight!”

“You had best get some answers in Sifu Advika,” said Daewoo, taunting the old tutor.

“Question three! Final question!” Shouted Sun, giddy with the proximity of victory. “Let’s go Hye!”

The blows were more targeted now. Advika had slowed the pace, forcing Hye on the offensive. Hye couldn’t know the score for sure, but she knew she had the edge with questions, now to seal it with the strikes. Advika, for the first time in Hye’s memory, seemed to be winded.

“Why?” Sun shouted. Classic. Open ended, ambiguous, interpretable.

“An—“ Advika tried to shout as Hye leaped, kicking in mid-air. Advika had never seen either of her students move with such speed and force. She stumbled backwards, barely blocking.

“Answer!” Shouted Hye.

“First response, Ward Hyeon!” Sun nearly shrieked, her glee uncontainable.

“A haven for life! Self contained, city sized, and hard to hurt, arcologies were banks for our greatest treasures—our citizens, our culture, and our children. From them issues agar, our future!”

“Response!’ Said Advika, batting away Hye’s victory blows.

“Judgement!” Said Sun, “Response requested!”

Daewoo pondered, “Hye has the core of it, yes. Some lovely phrasing. To the point. Top marks. Luck help you, Advika.”

“Fight!” Sun yelled.

Hye resumed her strikes. The old Sifu caught Hye’s hand and yanked her off balance, hurtling her across the ring and hard onto her back. 

“A haven, ha!” Advika advanced and stomped, a heal smash barely missing Hye as she rolled away. “Earth is *life*, the source, the home!” Advika hissed, “Arcologies are desperate life rafts, capsules against our self-made armageddon.” Advika moved at a speed the Vizier could barely perceive, flickering from strike to strike. Hye’s blocks were late, misplaced, or simply not strong enough. Neck, chest, knee, kidney, face all absorbed Advika’s rage. “Billions born only to die—not a haven for life, but factory for death. War-relics all, towering tombstones, crumbling and haunted, like the memories of the belligerence that begat them.” Hye had thrown a strike at a mirage only to find Advika behind her. “From them flows agar, like the Vaitarani, a river of sweet nectar, giving us new life for the price of forgetting our past.”  

Hye’s were arms barred, twisted and levered to the edge of tolerance. No no no, what had happened. She had *had* her.

“Submit submit submit,” Hye shouted, gasping with pain.

"Hyeon submits," shouted Sun, despondent, "Judgement?"

Daewoo was stunned. The battle before had paled, a mundane sparring compared to this last barrage. Hye had been so close—one more question and her luck might have held. There had been rumors that Advika had seen real battle in her youth, remnants of the Long War. Perhaps rumors no more.

“I, uh,” the Vizier stammered, “the Sifu is substantially more correct. And… I am moved.” The Vizier struggled to look at Advika in the eyes.

“In the final tally,” Sun said mournfully, “Sifu has won the Duel decisively while Hye’s net question responses were higher, only marginally so. Sifu wins.”

“Wonderful,” said Advika, releasing Hye, now cheery, “Since you’ll no longer be distracted with your campaign, I’ll expect you both at the ceremony commemorating of the Peace. I am sure the Ambassador’s retelling of the first accord’s signing will be just as riveting as last year’s.” 

The girls moaned with displeasure. 

The Vizier interrupted Advika as she tried to walk past, “Ah, Sifu? The Viceroy?”

“Yes yes,” she picked up her staff and adjusted her robes.

Hye looked at Sun, downcast and ashamed. Her sister stared into nothing, as if watching her future warp and bend out of her control. Hye sat, head in hands. How was she going to fix this? The Selection could begin any week now.

Then—a thought. Crown business. War relics. If it was important enough for the Viceroy to summon Advika personally...

"Wait! Vizier Daewoo," Hye said, straightening, "we are coming."

"This is business of the crown—something newly discovered from the war. Your attendance is not required or requested."

“For our edification?”

“Right,” said Sun, brightening as she caught on, “hasn’t the Viceroy always mentioned Wards don’t *really* understand. How else can Hyeon learn? I will tutor her as we watch the Sifu.”

The Sifu let slip a sly grin.

“It’s not campaigning Sifu,” said Hye, impassive, serious.

“We Wards are not so ignorant, else the Viceroy wouldn’t have me as Vizier. But well enough, then. We are late and I don’t feel like arguing, come come.”
