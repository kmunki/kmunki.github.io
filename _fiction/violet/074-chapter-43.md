The Grand Royal Palace of the Five Elements of the New Joseon Dynasty was its own majestic microcosm of a city with in the heart of the sprawling, sky-scraping Seoul. Within the palace walls were an auspicious three-hundred and three buildings. Over the centuries, the palace had been palaces, five, as one might guess, each burned, rebuilt, razed, invaded, augmented, converted, evacuated, and restored almost as many times. At one point, it was only a scorched patch of earth, nothing remaining of the palace but the memory.  Yet, ask any resident of Seoul how long the palace had stood—“As long as the Joseons,” they would answer, proudly meaning enough centuries to be within striking distance of a millennia. Owing to its phoenix-like resurrection and expansion to eight square kilometers of gardens, promenades, temples, gates, residences, halls, throne rooms, shrines, offices, bridges, and chambers, it was both a modern marvel and an ancient wonder.

 Of these the Chamber of Harmonic Discord was, if one could manage to get in when council was in session, was among the most entertaining places in all of Koryo, though not intentionally so. Comprised of eighty-eight royals, plus the Viceroy and Vizier, the council filled their chamber with  boisterous, uproarious debate. Each of its entrances was a portal to one of the few places in all of Koryo where decorum and pretense were dropped entirely. As much amphitheater as meeting hall, the chamber put the Vizer and Viceroy at the edge of a circle, councilor seats radiating out from them like ripples from a great rock dropped just off the shore of a pond. The effect was one of compression, the councilors stacked upon one another, all visible to one another, and to the Vizier and Viceroy, whom they all faced. 

At each of the compass directions, high on four of the eight encircling walls, were ornate boards, carved from dark wood and inlayed with polished stone. These boards scintillated with light, blue, white, and red. All boards mirrored the others—when one light lit, its cardinal cousins did as well. Each light was the voice of a councilor who could mash the button of their choice—against, abstain, agree—adding their opinion to the shifting shimmer of colors that tracked the mood and ebb of the arguments.

From the outside, the chamber had the appearance of a wide, squat pagoda. Its eight sides decorated each with a different artist’s interpretation of the triple taegeuk, the three primary colors swirling towards the shared center, brilliant in the sun. Banners of the New Joseon dragon hung from all eight flying eaves. They rippled and snapped in the crisp winter air. Hye felt a strange blend of pride and nostalgia, that awe of idealism, seeing the best in what the building stood for inspire of knowing the flawed reality of what was within. A luxury of the palace complex’s sheer massive scope, was that it had its own station. Daewoo had bid them stay, enjoy the luxuries and privacy of her train car, if for nothing else to avoid being seen until there was no stopping them. Let the session get into full swing, she had said. After that, you have a thirty minute window.

The Sifu stood, resting on her staff, admiring the grounds. Hye wished she could ask for reassurance, that the Sifu could respond, it will be alright. But she, no more than Hye, knew the future. How much of her life had been determined by luck? Little dice rolls and coin tosses, the shaking of sticks and turning of cards? Too much. Time to bet on myself. 

The din of almost a hundred opinionated individuals attempting to talk over one another was cut short when the chamber doors opened. Councilors she had courted for Sun’s Selection turned to look, faces agog. There, on the dais, were Ji-woo and Daewoo, one stunned, the other, only seemingly so.

“Viceroy-elect Prince Yi Ji-woo,” yelled Hye, cutting through the scandalized whispers and gasps, “I accuse you of treason and conspiracy against the state of Koryo, the New Joseon Dynasty, and the Continuum to which we are member.”

For a heartbeat, she was met with aghast silence, then, mayhem. Council members screaming “I knew it!” or “Madness!” or “Who is that!?” at once. Hye never let her gaze waver from Ji-woo. He was eerily calm. A single eyebrow had raised at her claim and then he smiled. Guards rushed over and grabbed the Ward and Sifu under the arms, ready to cart them out of the chambers.

Vizier Daewoo leaned over to the ranking guard in the room leading the proceedings.

“Quiet! Stand down!” Commander Ryong’s voice sang out through the apoplexy. Her guards, unbelieving, only loosened their grip, but did not let go. “Release them!” She clarified. “Councilors, I present our unexpected attendees, royal Ward Yi Hyeon Bong-cha and her rearer, guest of the palace by decree of former Viceroy Min-yoon, Sifu Advika Shidao.” Chastened, the other guards complied and stood aside.

Murmurs among the council members began again almost immediately, like a trickle of rain as it escalates towards a downpour.

“But the Sifu is wanted! We have a warrant for her!”

The murmur rose to a rabble, councilors looking around at one another, as if to confirm their amazement was not singular.

“Please, council, please,” said Ji-woo rising. “While this is a most surprising way to learn you are both well, it is not an entirely unwelcome one. Ward Hyeon, Sifu Shidao, we are so pleased to have you back among us again. Now, I must admit I’m not much delighted by the claims of treason, but you have been through much and perhaps news has not reached you. The council has selected *me* as Viceroy-elect. Enthronement is a week away. There was no duress. No coup. The attack was a tragedy, one whose precise nature remains elusive. Its perpetrators,” Ji-woo paused, his gaze lingering on the Sifu, “*will* be brought to justice. If it could calm you, of course, we could vote, here and now, as to whether or not I should be Viceroy? Let the councilors decide again, with you present to certify the results?”

Hye’s resolve, for an instant, failed. Had the Zaqqum tricked her? The Vizier? Was it a double bluff to expose and trap them? Her eyes flicked from Ji-woo’s placid face to Daewoo’s. She looked desperate, her eyes wide with earnest encouragement. No, she knew what was right. She let the burning core of truth kindle into a flame in her chest.

“No vote. I, Yi Hyeon Bong-Cha, Ward and fellow royal, challenge you to Crane-Dragon Duel for the Viceregency of Koryo and the Throne of the New Joseon Dynasty.”

Startled hisses and minor exclamations escaped the council members lips.

Ji-woo laughed, “Hye, my sister, I know you were eager for Sun’s selection—”

“You’re a puppet of Violet,” Hye continued. “Council, have you not been surprised, at this oaf’s sudden silken speech? Ji-woo’s new found eloquence is rehearsed and coached by a shadowed hand.”

Rib nudges, forceful whispers, and splutters of exasperation rippled among the council.

The Prince stoped laughing, “Bold claims, Ward. Your little sparring game has little to do with the throne of—” Ji-woo halted, his eyes slipping from the Ward and Sifu to the council, whose rumbling had grown. Now they eyed *him* with suspicion.

“Your Grace,” Daewoo said, clearing her throat before continuing, “though rarely called upon, the Ward’s challenge *is* among our traditions. It is in the scroll. Master of Law, if you please?” 

An elderly woman within the innermost circle rose and, after searching for the passage, read, “During the period between selection and enthronement, any royal may challenge the elect for the throne by the test of intelligence and fortitude, Crane-Dragon Duel. For the physical, no weapons are allowed and traditional kumite rules are to be followed. For the intellectual, the challenged may select the topic. The combined councils must vote to approve the challenge.” 

“Thank you master,” said Daewoo. She turned to the broader council, “You have all sworn to uphold these laws and traditions, vows renewed just yesterday in preparation the elect’s enthronement ceremonies and swearing in. A challenge has been heard and, now, it must be voted upon. And I must admit, Prince, that I have found your rise to power having perhaps one too many strokes of good luck. I will vote to allow the challenge.”

Again chaos. Council members factioned off. The light boards flickered and pulsed with votes for and against. 

“I see now,” Ji-woo, eyes locked on the Vizier, his voice icy and hard as a winter pond, “it seems there is some concern. Since Vizier Daewoo has so graciously cast the first vote, let me cast the final: I agree with the motion.” 

In an instant, a huge chunk of the board went red with assent, and, save for a few flickers as votes were added, there it stayed. Ji-woo smiled wider now, seeing the shock and confusion on Hye’s face. 

“How exciting! It seems the challenge will move ahead. My *good* Vizier, please do tell us, how do we proceed from here.”

He had known, she realized. *He was expecting her*.

“The challenged sets the topic,” said Daewoo, stumbling for a moment, like someone who when expecting resistance, finds none, “The council selects three impartial judges and a question master. Traditionally, it is the Masters of Martial Form, Law and History, and Rhetoric and Verse, with Vizier presiding.”

“Very well. Council?”

Again, within instants, the board glowed an affirmative red.

“Marvelous. We are decided. Ward Hyeon, while I must admit this is *something* of a surprise, I would happily assent to the challenge today, you, however, appear to be rather exhausted. Bedraggled one might say. But we have time. The official coronation is in seven days. That should be plenty of time to rest, no? Ward Hyeon, I must thank you. I know several members of the council, and my dear Vizier included, have been uncomfortable with how things have preceded. You’ve given me a gift, a path to prove my worthiness beyond mere vote-getting, but to show I am a leader, ready to rule. In return, let me give you the gift of rest. To defeat an opponent already so defeated would be, for me, no victory at all. We had hoped for your return and, as such, your quarters are, I believe, waiting for you. Sifu, I am not sure your regular residence here has been prepared. With so many guests and your absence, it was an oversight I now regret. But Vizier, surely we could accommodate her among the ambassadors? Several of our guest palaces are nearly full, but we will find you a room befitting your status.”

Hye’s bones throbbed with fatigue. The adrenaline, stolen away by Ji-woo’s calm graciousness, no longer vivified. His confidence was unsettling, disturbing. She had expected the idiot, the incoherent Ji-woo, terrified by any threat. Instead she found the prickle of fear creeping up her own spine. I will need my strength, she thought, I will need my sharpness.

“I accept,” Hye answered. “A rest would be welcome. The topic?”

“Wonderful. Six days from now, double three, enough luck for both of us. All will be smooth. For the topic, that’s easy enough: Which of us most deserves to rule?”
