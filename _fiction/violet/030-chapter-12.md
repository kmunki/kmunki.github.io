“Agar is at the heart of it,“ said Vizier Daewoo as she and Sifu Advika resumed their stroll through the quiet woods behind the Summer Palace.

Fall had settled in, morning dew replaced with frost and the mid-day air clear and cold. In the few weeks since the Olgoi, Advika had mended, the chrys-cast needing little time. She was relieved to remove it. Weight bearing and quite strong, the cast's encumbrance was not the primary discomfort. No, that centered on the knowledge that like its namesake chrysalis, the cast liquified the leg—*her* leg—to heal it, letting the cells regress to pluripotency before reconstituting. As with most of nature, its workings were both miraculous and revolting. But worse than visceral repulsion, the sensation had been unearthing a long-buried memory. Her mind, like a grave robber racing the sun, had struck the coffin lid and begun scraping away dirt when the cast was mercifully removed. The past was left interred.

Daewoo, soft and sentimental, was particularly pleased to have her walking partner returned to her. Lone walks of quiet contemplation with her own thoughts as company were not her preferred way of enjoying the palace grounds. 

“Edge-land is expensive,” the Sifu agreed, “to claim, more so to hold. Agar recoups costs, but… the Viceroy did not *know *there would be agar.”

“Oh, had only there been no sabotage! Curse our luck!” The Vizier struck her fist into her soft palm, “We’re barely at break even. Are not the Wilds hard enough? Why must we live in such interesting times? Still… Sun may yet earn a boon.”

The Sifu frowned.

“She’s earned it! Hye too. Or is that your meaning?”

“Yin and yang since before my arrival, one’s victory is the other’s. That the bid is Sun’s alone is force of tradition not a decision of her’s or Hye’s. No,” said the old Sifu, adjusting her robes, “were the decision mine, neither would bid.”

“*Neither?*” Daewoo was stunned to stillness, her jaw agape. She blinked and shuffled forward, catching up with Advika, who had not paused, “Someone must be the next Viceroy. In-yeong dailies in announcing but will not delay in abdication. Who among themselves could the royals select that you would prefer? You do not support them, your own students?”

“I am not so cruel,” said the old Sifu, a slight wound in her voice. “I have seen how power, and its pursuit, can tarnish even the best of intent. Concessions and compromises fast become corruption and cruelty. Already Hye complicates her simple kindness. Saving that Olgoi transport was inspired by her innate goodness, but was expressed as a tactic, a possible strategic edge, in the battle to become Viceroy. I would be happy, and proud, to see Sun assume the Viceregency, and, prouder still to have her the Continuum’s Chief Magistrate. But in taking up those mantles, she must become them, and thus change, and Hye with her. Where responsibility connects, authority corrodes.”

“You sound weary, old friend,” said the Vizier, “politics is the imperfect vessel of progress.”

“War by other means,” said Advika.

“A cliché! Sifu that is unlike you,” the Vizier tut-tuted, “other means, yes. But peaceful ones! Not yet a month ago you forced me to watch your martial combat and yet it is you who speak of war and spit.”

“Preparation is not provocation.”

“I have advised Viceroys to sign treaties to the contrary.”

“To sharpen a blade is not the same as brandishing it. A ready defense—”

“Is also a ready offense, Sifu,” said Daewoo, “you know that well as I do. Aphorisms today then? How about: The enemy’s mind is always unknown, we must see both faces in their fullness.”

“You would lecture *me* on the art of war, Vizier?”

"On the purpose of politics, Sifu. Which is not to win, but to get what one wants, or at least what one needs. Yet my lecture here is just as foolhardy, I see, as you're sighing with recognition. There is no new information here, I'm—" She faltered, catching herself lecturing a master. For a moment they walked in silence, the wind rustling the leaves and the last birds of fall chirping at one another, each amazed the other remained. She took a breath. "I'm saying what you already know, but, I suspect, do not believe. Or, perhaps, not when you hear it from yourself."

The old Sifu did not look at her friend, nor did she speak. Leaves crunched underfoot against the flagstones paving the path, her walking staff a thudding fifth foot-fall, giving the sound of their steps an odd rhythm. Fears and memories, etched in her mind by history hard lived, ached like joints before a storm.

“Hope is the acorn of humiliation, Eun.”

“Oh Advika,” said the Vizier, “to wish for a better world and act as if it should be so is no great error.”

“All great villains tell themselves as much, my dear Vizier,” said the old tutor, a hard formality returning to her voice, “better worlds! They promise. And so often they need to build so badly that when bricks run out, few hesitate to continue on with bodies and bones.

My fear is not that Sun and Hye will not make the world better. I believe they could, they shall. But in doing so it is the world that will make them worse, and that I cannot bear to see. Not again.”

“I fear we shall never agree on this, Sifu,”

“May we both live long enough to find out.”

The Vizier laughed hard and loud, the tension in her chest startled free by the Sifu’s grim well-wishing, “How you make longevity seem like a punishment. What did they do to you all those years ago, to make you such a cynic? We found you fishing! Not precisely what anyone would describe as torture. What ever will we…” Daewoo paused as she felt Advika’s touch on her shoulder. She was pointing. 

There, standing in the path dappled with the mid-day sun, was an owl. Muted white, spotted brown, her huge black eyes were alert in her bobbing, searching head. Daewoo was laughing once again.

“Hodu!” Exclaimed Daewoo, her voice bouncing with levity, “It’s just past noon! You’re up awful early. What are you doing there on the path?”

A confounded *oohoo *escaped the anachronistic owl. She was not looking at them, Advika realized, but perhaps was desperate to, as though she knew they were close but could not find them.

“Hodu,” said the old Sifu approaching, her own purple-in-white eyes wide, seeking the inky black of the owl’s, “why are you awake?”

The owl hooted, then made a half-screech. In a voice somewhere between an eagle scream and a dove coo, she said, “Dark. See.”

“Oh she does not sound good,” said Daewoo, joy smothered by concern.

Advika handed her staff to the Vizier and knelt down, wincing as the joints protested, her face near level with the disturbed owl’s.

“She is supposed to be here, this is her section.”

“Yes but not now, it’s daytime. You never see owls in daylight. Even hybrids stick to their schedules.”

Hodu was moving her head faster now, inscribing circles in the air, as though seeking a peephole a wall that was not there. Her wings flapped with agitation.

“Can you see me, little guard owl” said Advika, compassion enveloped in command as she moved her hand in front of its face, “can you see this?”

Another screech. 

Terror, confusion. "No see. Dark. Spin," Hodu said.

The owl listed to one side, its talons scrabbling against the stone for purchase. She flung her wings out and beat them, attempting to right herself and, failing that, to prevent total capsize.

“She’s sick,” said the old tutor, scooping up the guard owl, “Blind. Dizzy. Disoriented.”

“But there are no– or so few, rare– not for years now, sick?” Daewoo had not dared let herself think that word. Sickness meant disease. Disease could be plague. And plagues were weapons of war. This was how it would start.

“No,” said Advika, “she doesn’t smell sick. Could be something she ate. Or poison. But she’s lived here for years now,” her mind ticking through the facts, “she wouldn’t make a mistake like that.”

“Not alone,” the weak owl hooted.

To Daewoo’s eyes there was no intervening moment between Advika being knelt on the ground, holding the owl, and the next, standing poised to fight, the owl tucked under one arm, a knife from god knows where wielded in the other. She was scanning the forest, well beyond the path’s edges, looking deep into the shadows beyond the trees.

“We must–”

Advika hissed her silent. The forest was quiet, well lit, pillars of light pushing their way from the tree tops to the forest floor, revealed all. Empty. No sound. No scent. Nothing visible. But they were not alone. The owl was right, though no single sense could prove it, in the gestalt of the negative space, a presence.

“We must go, we must go,” said Daewoo pulling on the Sifu’s sleeve, “please.”

Advika tilted her head side to side, letting each ear have the high ground. The owl shuddered in her embrace, a living alarm bell.

“Advika please,” Daewoo begged, “we don’t even know if Hodu means that or if she is hallucinating. She could be dying. She could be *contagious*. Please!”

Nothing. The guard owl must be confused. Have confused her. Old sensations, flashbacks, and fears clouded her senses. There was nothing in the woods, she told herself. Not alone could mean anything. Whatever it was, if it was even anything, it was not attempting to use the Vizier’s irrepressible outbursts as cover for its own movements. Only silence and the susurration of leaves.

Another screech and shudder, Hodu's breathing ragged. Advika sheathed her knife and they started walking briskly towards the palace.

“Hold on, Hodu,” said Daewoo.

But she could not. The owl, so light, so fragile in Advika’s hand drew in a desperate breath.

“Not alone. Dark. Not alone.”

“She doesn’t want to die alone. We are here, Hodu, we are here,” said Daewoo, petting the feathers on the side of the owl’s face.

Advika felt the owl exhale, then she was still. No next inhalation came.

She paused. Gently, she pressed her ear to the raptor’s unmoving chest.

“We are too late,” said Advika. 

Daewoo stifled a sob.

“Come,” said Advika, cradling the expired hybrid.

“Shouldn’t we…” Daewoo couldn’t finish the sentence.

"Quarantine is for contagions," Advika said, walking again. "Nothing kills that fast. Even the worst engineered plagues took half a day to incubate and hours of suffering. Hodu was disoriented, blinded, and she was standing just minutes ago. This is poison—a neurotoxin. There is nothing within ten times her range that could do this to her."

First the sabotaged transport. Now a poisoned guard owl. Advika could see the same thoughts on the Vizier’s face. Together, mournful, they walked the long path of through the forest back to the Summer Palace, the cold fall air biting their cheeks and ears.
