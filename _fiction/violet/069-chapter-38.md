Nairobi’s city-lower night life was in full thrum. Hoards of people and hybrids bathed in the spectra of acid neon light. Moto drag races and street brawls broke out a few ape swings from up-and-coming clubs and exclusive lounges. Rain, warm and thin, fell indiscriminately, making mirrors of every surface. Below her feet the city-under could be heard: the chaotic, chromatic cries of hyena and the bat-like chirruping of the painted wild dogs were the altos and sopranos to the lion baritone and elephant bass. Filling out the chorus were the legion voices of smaller, prolific creatures, each attempting to find its place amid that unnatural nature.

The streets had thinned somewhat as Illapa moved beyond the main hub of nightlife. Here were the noodle shops, the splicing parlors, the cheap bars among purveyors of all things of legal ambiguity. Down an alley a thin crowd huddled around three-card monty, a chimp dealer bobbing from side to side as her long arms wove a pattern of distraction. The illusion of chance. Maybe all gambling was such: pre-determined, only our ignorance making it appear random luck.

Time and life had turned the streets into old rivers, full of s-bends and switch backs, often barely wide enough for moto traffic and bicycles. Detours and make-do tunnels through buildings and overgrowth alike made pathfinding more art than science. Yet she found the market. Not overfull, it was busy with vendors selling as they had for millennia, piling their goods high and shouting at each passer by, arguing and haggling and insulting and cajoling. A little troop of peccary and boor negotiated with a petite, wide-eyed woman over a pile of apples; a young girl, no more than seven, poked at veet-steaks, harassing the stoic magpie vendor; a bored woman with a turban picked up each of her oranges, ensuring that they weren’t showing some hideous defect to explain the lack of attention. 

An odd little decoration dangled from the cart—just as Vidya described.

Illapa plucked an orange from the pile, tossed a coin to the merchant, and walked into the narrow street behind the stall. The alley dead-end in a small clothing shop. Behind her, the woman’s cart now had a display of woven cloths, high and wide enough, it just so happened, to obscure the alley.

Battered mannequins draped with delicate abayas and thawbs stood in the window and throughout the clothing shop. At the desk was a dapper young woman who wore an anachronistic suit, her hair slicked to her head. An ornate gold chain swooped from her nose to ear, dangling with charms across her left cheek. Her suit was cut such that her shoulders and collarbones were exposed. These were covered in shimmering scales; starting small at the base of her neck, they grew into blue-white bone-like shards that flared from her shoulders. The nose-chain and shoulder splice alike stood out against her dark skin. On the counter, splayed out as if it had landed there from a great height, was the fattest gerbil Illapa had ever seen.

“Greetings, I’m here for a tuxedo,” Illapa ventured.

The woman raised an eyebrow, then rolled her eyes.

“Euro fever is over, didn’t anyone tell you? I don’t make things that are out of fashion.”

“I’ll take some lederhosen then.”

“Same problem. Worse, really. Do you even know what those are? I make a lovely salwar. Or a kurta perhaps? Look around,” she indicated the displays around the store with the barest of movement, “do you see anything European in here?”

“Mm… no, but that’s what I want. I’m something of a *connoisseur*.”

Illapa lingered on the last word, the end of the back and forth key phrases. 

“I see,” said the woman, “there may be something for you in the back then.”

She slid the gerbil to the side, lifted a portion of the counter and gestured for Illapa to come through. Illapa passed through a curtain into a tiny space, with three nooks for dressing areas.

“The last one, please,” said the woman. Illapa went inside and drew the curtain. There was a click and a light hydraulic sound. She began to descend through the floor. 

There was a mechanical clunk as the false floor closed above her. Dim lights clinked on along a metal-walled corridor, wooden and steel ribbing holding it in place. Hunched, she made her way, her hands acting as make-do whiskers. Through gaps in the ramshackle metal, she could see the jungle of the city-under below; or, more often, the jungle coming *in* as a venturesome leaf or vine. At the tunnel end was a small steel cart poking out of a circular concrete opening. The cart was just long enough for her to lay down upon and the opening just wide enough to admit the cart with her on it. She positioned herself and had barely settled before the cart began to move.

The tunnel was dark. A few clicks and whirs; the cart paused; she braced. It started as a pricking, almost tingling on her finger tips and a light scratching on her boots. Moments later, she was covered by the gripping feet of dozens of cockroaches, tasting her. Not properly hybridized so much as just given a boost to be more trainable. Little buggers knew enough to tell if you were friend or foe. Antennae, legs, wing brushes, she restrained a shiver as they swarmed around her. Please let Vidya have given them everything they need to know who she was.

A cover slid open and light poured in. The little feet now scrabbled away and Illapa was dragged into the open. A hand reached down, pulling her standing as her eyes adjusted. The hoisting hand resolved itself into an ESA operative.

The office itself was Keralan. Compared with the ornate and intricate Koryo palace or the gaudy luxury of the mercenaries, the simple, almost austereness of it was soothing. Well maintained, but far from polished. There were scuffs and dings, scratches and stains—on everything and everyone. The main room was a large oval, with smaller rooms budding off of it. Various operatives were sifting through piles of paper, tuning electronics on devices that should not have electronics, and maintaining weapons. The low ceilings, gave it a cramped, intimate feeling. Her kind of field office, she thought. Give me the first draft, the rough and ready, the barely working. When behind enemy lines, what fun is it to have a full fledged facility to run home to when things are hard? Illapa had always preferred to be the bullet rather than pull the trigger. The explosive launch, spiraling down the barrel, a fiery escape only to end up in the fray. A breather, a briefing, and a handful of bandages and bullets and out you go again. Now *that *is a field office. 

“Ah, welcome, Illapa, come on over.”

Hunched over a work-bench on which was a largish briefcase, Vidya wafted over the spy, as though she were a pleasant aroma. The Keralan was working on… well it wasn’t quite a brief case was it? Much larger, like a cylindrical sitar case, oddly tapered. It reminded Illapa of a coffin.

“I must admit this is a special treat for me, Illapa. The ESA offices always felt such a paltry comparison. Of course Keralan field offices can be a bit bland, but one does not rule the world without a bit of belt tightening and make-do.”

“You don’t rule the world.”

“Not yet, no, not yet. Anyway, you’re not here for the decor. Glad you came cleanly out of that situation with the Blade. We’ve corroborated the evidence as best we can, all signs point to the mercenary telling you the truth—Ji-woo is a puppet of Violet. His coronation will put Violet in effective control of Koryo and, then—”

“The Continuum,” said Illapa.

“Precisely. The manipulations would be invisible. It’s not unlikely Violet would be invited to join. Not ideal. Need you to stop it.”

“I’m headed back to Koryo?”

“Indeed. Stop the ceremony and expose Violet if you can.”

“How?”

“No idea. But I’m sure you’ll figure it out. You’ll be sent as an ambassador, there to view the ceremony. There are not many pleasures working with the Inka, but your capricious and mysterious autocracy does lend itself some useful cover in terms of why things happen. No one will ask or even notice such odd behavior. Abnormal for the rest of us is normal for your people.”

“Better than bowing to an old crone covered head-to-toe in jewels.”

Vidya shrugged, “I know the face and name of my ruler. She answers to parliament.”

“It is sad you do not trust her,” said Illapa.

Vidya laughed, “We shall likely never see eye-to-eye on this, Illapa, but I do enjoy the banter. That the Sapa exists at all, let alone rules, is something of a wonder to me. I’ve always been fascinated with Inkan culture. So many biodemographic strategies, be they the Zhongguo’s *renlei mu ye *or our own *maanav paalan *are explicit, loud, strident beliefs. We fight about them! Is there any greater fight in the world? The whole Shadow has been devoted to testing and retesting the theories. And yet you and the Inka… you barely discuss it. You just do.”

“We named it.”

“You certainly did. *Kachana kawsay*. *Command life*. What a phrase! And that is how your world is run, is it not? The Sapa are invulnerable, invisible, all commanding. You control and direct all of your society like one great machine.”

“One great being, Vidya, my sweet. To be in command of one’s life is the highest attainment.” Illapa stood a bit taller. “All societies should be so lucky as to come as close as we have to attaining it. I mean,” she grinned slightly, “look at me. Look at us. The Keralans and Inka together. We do not pair because we are the same, we are different. Now enough philosophy, what’s this here then?”

She ran a hand along the large briefcase thing that Vidya had been modifying.

“Generous of you to make me such a lovely coffin, but I don’t plan on dying just yet. And when I do you certainly won’t be putting what’s left of me in there.”

“Illapa please! It’s not a coffin. It’s, well I’m not entirely sure what to call it. It’s a kind of escape pod, I suppose.”

“Escape? I would never,” Illapa said, smirking.

“Tsh. You see you press this button here, and here and—no don’t touch it!” Vidya swatted Illapa’s hand away. “I’ve just spent all morning tuning it and I’ll not have you waste my work with your oafishness. Now be serious and pay attention. You press here and here,” she repeated, pointing to the buttons without touching them, “it will open. It can hold you and some gear or, in a pinch, another person, though the fit will be very tight. Bring mints. There is a small tracking and guidance system here. It pursues the *Chomba’s *signal directly. A small liquid crystal display will provide guidance.”

“What’s this button”

“That triggers your escape. Make sure you are *inside *the pod when you press it and the *pod* is outside. And that there is nothing in front of the pod for fifty meters. I’m sure you’ll find a way to use it regardless of necessity.”

“I appreciate your confidence.”

“Go see wardrobe for your dresses, they all have the standard adjustments and enhancements. This *coffin* will be delivered to your carriage.”

As promised, the formal dresses were interwoven with arachnoweave. With a tuck and clip they became tactical pants and top, allowing for more practical movements. The cut was such that leg holsters disappeared. Armed and fitted, she picked up the huge case, and made to leave as Ambassador Illapa, honored guest to the Koryo enthronement.

“A moment, Agent,” said Vidya as Illapa walked past her office door.

Illapa halted. Vidya was at her desk, scrutinizing her comm. If for nothing else than curiosity, she stepped inside and, on instinct, closed the door behind her. A lone chair sat opposite Vidya’s desk. Best to sit. Vidya’s thinking, which despite the furious pace of her mind, was a thorough process. Her office was dim, lamp lit, no windows. The walls were books, many old and peeling. What titles Illapa could read seemed impossibly dull. On the corner of the desk, a small bronze statue, Hindu in style, depicting a man on one knee, winged, and with the head of a bird. The bird-person held his right palm towards the sky and in their left, held a censor, or orb of some kind. From a box at its feet, the velvety smoke of incense drifted upwards toward the low, simple ceiling.

“That is Garuda, King of the Birds, vahana of Vishnu, and my family’s namesake. He sets me at ease.”

“Something interesting?” Illapa nodded at the comm.

Vidya let out a huff of a laugh. She knew her face gave her away, painful as it was to admit. Stoicism was a point of pride for her. But Illapa was more perceptive than most. Surprising for an Inka. Not so surprising, however, as the stream of words across the tiny screen of her comm. There were several possible explanations. Most obvious, that the Olokun was lying, and, in doing so, attempting to deceive and undermine the agent of one of her mortal enemies. Yet this information would not modify their mission, not directly. So unlikely. Another possibility was that her information was simply wrong, though for one of her skill to transmit such information believing it true and herself mislead seemed—implausible. Of all the answers, though, what she now read, seemed, impossible as it was, to be most likely to be true.

“Thank you for your patience, Illapa.”

“Rare I get time with my thoughts.”

“I imagine both of them are delighted for the company.”

Illapa feigned to stand. Vidya raised a hand. 

“Wait, wait. Apologies. I… do not know how to share this information. It feels patently absurd and also obviously correct.”

“Let me get it, same as you. Show me the comm.”

Vidya began to hand the device across the desk and, half way, froze, unsure. For an instant, she could keep that information from not just Illapa, but the world. For a bit longer, the past would stay buried. Illapa leaned forward and plucked the device from her hand.

The Inkan’s face was wry, expecting some titillating gossip of another of Ursine’s historic conquests. As the words ticked by, her eyes narrowed. Her arched brow furrowed. She leaned into it, drawing the comm close, holding it with both hands, as though it were weighty, or unstable. Not a long message. Time enough elapsed for three full passes. There was no mistaking the meaning.

“You believe this?” Illapa asked, not able to look up.

“I do.”

“Sapa and serpent feathers.”

“Indeed.”

“Starts to explain some things. She’s aged well, eh?”

Vidya laughed, harder than warranted as it escaped under pressure.

“Should we all be so lucky,” she added, composing herself.

“Whatever she is could—” she caught herself—“there are opportunities for Condor and Kerala both if we were able to get an alliance, bring her into the fold.”

“Even get a sample.”

“Is that an order? Bring her back dead or alive?”

“An ancillary objective. Ji-woo and Violet remain the more imminent threat. She should have died ages ago, asura or no. That neither time nor the dozens who would have put her on trial for crimes against humanity and civilization have been able to stop her bodes well for a partnership, should one be possible.”

“A partnership? With *her?* She deserves death not allies.”

“Which war do you want to win, Illapa? Today’s or last century’s.”

“No one won the last one.”

Vidya nodded as her gaze drifted to the incense burner. She watched the smoke curl around the legs and up through the wings and hands.

“How many Inka died in the Long War?”

“You know the answer,” the Inka responded.

“Yes, I do. Three hundred and forty-three million, seven-hundred thousand, two-hundred and sixty two is the most correct count, but of course, record keeping became rather poor for the several years of the war. Twelve million, eight-hundred thousand, six-hundred and twelve died in the first three months when the plagues of Ananda were unleashed. Our numbers were similar, worse in some ways, better in others, but a tragedy, same as yours.”

Illapa had gone still, deadly.

“Your point, Vidya?”

“History is done. Settled. Vengeance empties no graveyards. Our disappointment in that truth does not make it a lie. Knowledge is our priority, an edge against what is coming. Once Violet’s puppet is dealt with, we must see if we can gain the old asura’s allegiance. The Olokun understood such a bargain with you. She would be a near infinite source of intelligence and interest.”

“And if she is unwilling?”

“Justice.” 

“After all this time.”

“Don’t forget your coffin, Ambassador.”
