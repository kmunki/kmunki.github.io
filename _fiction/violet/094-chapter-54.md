Ji-woo shook. Fury and fear fought for control such that the Viceroy-elect stood frozen, staring at Oni. Her face was a moonscape, inscrutable. The all-black eyes gave him nothing, her gaze on the busy courtyard below. All but the residence had been unlocked, but few would notice one building of fifty, hardly thirty of a thousand guests missing amid a small, temporary city of strangers. The asura’s brow was un-furrowed, despite her accusation.

“I failed *you*?” His mind, awash in adrenaline and cortisol, could do little else in response but restate her insult with haughty derision. Some incredulous part of him struggled to the fore, taking the reins of his stuttering muscles. “I am the *Viceroy*.” His shoulders squared, neck straightened, eyes bugged, more like an angry customer than impassioned sovereign. He continued. “I do not answer to you, Oni. *You *said you’d deal with them. Now you’ve already lost the Ward. *She *is the problem I do not *care *if the old woman is dead or not it is not *she *who is challenging me for the throne!”

Hideyo wheeled on him, grabbing the Prince by his narrow, shaking shoulders.

“Understand this, cuckoo. You are Viceroy at *my *pleasure. It is you who owe *me*.”

Her words thundered through his mind, stampeding all other thoughts. Primal terror made real, like a child seeing glowing eyes and hearing a hungry snarl from a darkened closet, threatened his bowel control.

“Every failure has been *yours*. You did not warn us about the old woman. You could not track down your own kin. You failed to secure the palace. You could not even keep the Ward in her room for a handful of hours. I would have taken her. She would have appeared to have run away. Her Sifu dead and in disgrace due to the busaw that she brought with her from the wilds. We could have even blamed the girl for it. But you clown, you utter moron, you merely had to follow my instructions, and yet too there you fail. What do these photos show but your failure?”

His gaze slid to the corners of his eyes, not daring to turn his face away. On his royal desk, the huge glazed wooden surface designed to dwarf any request to come across it, a vast continent of lawmaking to separate him from all others, were black-and-white images, minutes old. Stills from one of the cameras in the Residence. Set to closed loop to prevent any less than loyal guards from getting agitated at the sight of rampant cannibalism, there was only one scenario in which any footage would return: the armory. Motion detection plus a simple broadcast did not make for the sharpest picture, but the system proved rather tamper resistant, a plus when dealing with weaponry and politics. In the photos were three women. One he did not recognize, but the other two were, when one looked at all the images together, all too clear. Ward and Sifu, as alive as when they had stormed into the Chamber days ago.

“Remember this, Jiwoo, you mindless buffoon, that before me you were a joke. Without your Oni, you are a hopeless failure, doomed to being little more than a punchline. Your sudden rise to power has a cost, and that cost is fealty to *me*. If you are Viceroy it will be ”

Jiwoo stammered.

“Supplicate yourself.”

“I am… Viceroy of Koryo. I don’t—” 

“Supplicate—” his knees buckled—“cuckoo.”

Ji-woo had not genuflected since he was a fledgling. The rug fibers, though soft, brushed shame against his forehead and fingertips. There was cowering in this, it was not a humble bow but one wrung from him.

“You believe yourself a wild stallion, full of froth and speed. No, that is Koryo. You believe yourself the rider, then, mounted in the saddle, charging forward. No, that is me. You are reins, you idiot prince. A mere tool, conveying my whims. Say it.”

“I am your tool.” His voice was tremulous.

“Good. Now,” she thought aloud, “listen closely.”

She extended the spine from her hand, a shimmering drop of venom clung to the tip.

“Did you know there are four types of venom? For much of my life, I did not. Not even after I became an asura.” Ji-woo, having sat up now at attention, looked on in shock. “Yes, my stupid little cuckoo prince, I am an asura. That I have had to reveal this to you is part of my reason for your selection as my instrument. It is also why I must explain further the consequences of your next failure. When I was elevated to my current state, I did not initially grasp my powers. This spine injected a venom which seemed merely to paralyze and then kill. Over time, however, I learned that I have four distinct venom glands. They are incredibly small, clustered between my radius and ulna. Each, I’ve learned, produces one of the four types: neurotoxin, myotoxin, haematoxin, and necrotoxin.” She held the spine close, such that the hollow just under the tip was visible. “I’ve spent years experimenting with each, learning how to shift mixtures for my purposes. Most interesting is that my neurotoxin is not an anesthetic. When combined with the myotoxin, the poor victim is unable to move, the nervous system and the muscles themselves seized by demonic peptides. But the nerves still send signals home. This is important, Ji-woo, pay attention now. You will still feel pain. I will ensure you are fully immobile first, then I will inject every part of your body with the most sensory nerves—your lips, your eyes, your fingertips, your toes, your genitals—with necrotoxin. Each cell will scream in anguish as it dies under irreversible assault. There you will be, silent, immobile, wishing every instant for death, but to the outer observer merely asleep in bed, breathing softly, as a babe. This will not kill you, so after an hour, I will move to your teeth, your tongue, your bones. I will admit I am not sure how this part of the process feels, as those for whom we have allowed the paralytic to lapse are no longer able to speak. The total dissolution of their tongue is no barrier, of course, but they seem to be simply driven mad. Yet even in this state, they feel pain, so though you may attempt to break with reality, you will suffer in your fantasy as well. It is then that I inject the myotoxin, usually directly into the diaphragm. The effect is one of drowning and suffocating, but with salvation all around, a gasp away. Your body will reroute as much of the residual oxygen to your mind as it can, allowing all the other muscles and nerves, those thus far left untouched, to flair with anguish in your final moments. Should you fail me, Ji-woo, you will die insane and tormented like few ever have, with some of evolution’s most brutal weapons delivered with scientific precision.”

Ji-woo shook, unable to reply.

“Am I understood?”

He nodded, his skull stuttering up and down.

“Excellent. Here is what you shall do.”
