Stepped into the mountainside, the Summer Palace grounds were a more vertical affair than its southern city siblings. At its center, the vast Hall of Celestial Balance housed the Ruby Dragon Throne—where power was invested with ceremony, not where it was exercised. 

Daily life and business were conducted in the Palace of Civic Contemplation near the palace summit. Though small in relative grandeur, the council offices held stunning views of the Koryo mountains through walls that were little but glass with wood skeletons—a deliberate fusion of ancient style and modern materials built around a central meditative garden. No need for secrecy among royals.

As they entered the long hall to the Receiving Room in the Viceroy’s Council Chambers, they were met with laughing and shouting. A boisterous group of royals were approaching.

“Ugh,” said Sun, whispering to her sister, “Ji-woo.”

“It is unbecoming to be so loud,” said Vizier Daewoo, refusing to raise her voice, but well within their hearing, “you’re Progeny, Prince Ji-woo, act like it.”

“Ah, Vizier Daewoo!” Said the prince, louder than before, “and Hyeon, how lucky am I? My least favorite of the Wards. And foolish Princess Seong-ma with the old foreigner makes an unlucky four. I just came from seeing her grace, the Viceroy! I’m feeling very good about my chances at Selection.”

“Won’t that be a lucky fourth attempt for you, Ji-woo?” Asked Hye.

The prince scoffed. In his early fifties, he was still boyish and slight, wearing a suit of the most fashionable and ostentatious cut in the royal green, “at least I can try for it. The best you can hope for, Ward, is Vizier. Queen Hyeon of the Wards!” He raised his arms in mock reverence, then dropped them, “The tallest ant.” He grinned. “Seong-ma, a word of advice, if you’re going to embarrass yourself in running for Selection, at least get better advisors than these.”

“I’ve been advising Viceroys since you were still ecto-fresh.”

“And look at the state Koryo’s in. Time for a new—no, this once you’re right, Vizier— a *fresh* approach. Don’t worry, I’ll give you an honorable retirement.”

“Best win before making promises,” said Sun, attempting to walk past. “Usually royals tend to vote for someone they *respect*. You’re awful confident for a serial failure and perennial punchline.”

Ji-woo stepped forward, pressing close until they were nose-to-nose. Sun neither flinched nor blinked.

“This time, you foreigner-raised brat, it’s different. I’ve learned from my mistakes. I’m an ogre with an iron rod. I’m done begging for what is mine by right.”

“By right?” The Vizier said, stunned.

“You’re not going to win,” the prince persisted, “You don’t deserve to.”

He started laughing again and pushed past Hye and Sun.

"You think it's about earning it, or deserving it. Respect! Ha!" His posse followed. "That is your mistake, Seong-ma. Selection is about power—which you don't have and have no idea how to get. Those who are Selected *already have it*. And this time, *that's me*."
