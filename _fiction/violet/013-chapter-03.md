The Summer Palace stepped into the mountainside—a more vertical affair than its southern city siblings. Mid-way up stood the vast, ornate Hall of Celestial Balance with its double eaves and Ruby Dragon Throne. Beautiful, stunning, almost always empty—the hall was where power was invested with due ceremony, not where it resided or was exercised. 

Daily life and business of the Viceroy were conducted in the Palace of Civic Contemplation. Nestled near the top of the grounds, though small in relative grandeur, the Viceroy and her council's offices held stunning views of the Koryo mountains. A deliberate fusion of ancient style and modern materials, the Palace of Civic Contemplation was built around a central courtyard—a lush, meditative garden with walking paths. The surrounding walkways, topiaries, and lawns of the upper palace were visible through walls of glass and timber—transparent architecture that declared: no need for secrecy among royals.

As they entered the long hall to the Receiving Room, laughing and shouting echoed toward them. A boisterous group of royals approached.

“Ugh,” said Sun, whispering to her sister, “Ji-woo.”

“It is unbecoming to be so loud,” said Vizier Daewoo, refusing to raise her voice, but well within their hearing, “you’re Progeny, Prince Ji-woo, act like it.”

"Ah, Vizier Daewoo!" said the prince, louder than before. "And Hyeon—my least favorite of the Wards. Foolish Princess Seong-ma with the old foreigner makes an unlucky four. I just came from seeing Her Grace, the Viceroy! I'm feeling very good about my chances at Selection."

“Won’t that be a lucky fourth attempt for you, Ji-woo?” Asked Hye.

The prince scoffed. In his early fifties, he was still boyish and slight, wearing a suit of the most fashionable and ostentatious cut in the royal green, “at least I can try for it. The best you can hope for, Ward, is Vizier. Queen Hyeon of the Wards!” He raised his arms in mock reverence, then dropped them, “The tallest ant.” He grinned. “Seong-ma, a word of advice, if you’re going to embarrass yourself in running for Selection, at least get better advisors than these.”

“I’ve been advising Viceroys since you were still ecto-fresh.”

“And look at the state Koryo’s in. Time for a new—no, this once you’re right, Vizier— a *fresh* approach. Don’t worry, I’ll give you an honorable retirement.”

"Best win before making promises," said Sun, attempting to walk past. "Royals usually vote for someone they *respect*. You're awfully confident for a serial failure and perennial punchline."

Ji-woo lunged, nose-to-nose with Sun. She neither flinched, nor blinked.

"This time, you foreigner-raised brat, it's different. I've learned from my mistakes. I'm an ogre with an iron rod now—done begging for what is mine by right."

“By right?” The Vizier said, stunned.

“You’re not going to win,” the prince persisted, “You don’t deserve to.”

He started laughing again and pushed past Hye and Sun.

“You think it’s about earning it, or deserving it. Respect! Ha!” His posse followed. “That is your mistake, Seong-ma. Selection is about power. Power you don’t have and have no idea how to get. Those who are Selected *already have it*. And this time, the person who has it, *is me*.”

Viceroy In-yeong's mood was already curdled from Prince Ji-woo's visit. How the man managed to infuse every whinging phrase, each mincing gesture with such obsequiousness and pompousness would have been poetic were it not so irritating. Begging and demanding assistance in Selection. The gall! Five decades and yet his mind was as smooth and soft as his princely hands. Hundreds of royals, most true progeny, and that womb-error thought he deserved to rule, among all of them. To wield power. 

Now here she was, asking some foreign-born rearer brought in by her predecessor for a favor. The question was a bitter one.

“No, your majesty,” answered the Sifu.

Hah! What power? She could not get even this old foreign rearer to come to heel. 

"You see, General?" said Viceroy Yi In-yeong, leader of the New Joseon dynasty and Koryo head of state. She lacked Sun's cheekbones and almond eyes, thought Hye, but not her gaze. Beautiful and sharp, like sunlight through a loupe. Where it lingered, it burned. Save upon the Sifu, who remained cool as ever. The rest of the room shifted with discomfort.

“Sifu,” said Vizier Daewoo, attempting to placate, “this is within—”

“Eun, please,” said the Sifu, “it is not. No other rearer would be asked to go *negotiate* terms of suzerainty and taxation with an arcology. Min-yoon, may she be happy in the heavens, was clear: I am to rear these two,” she gestured at Sun and Hye, “until they were both twenty-five years of age. My directive is simple: ‘teach them: ensure they survive this world and one day make it better.’ That is all. I am not your subject, your majesty.”

“By the Great Golden Emperor above, Advika, you are a stubborn woman,” said General Jee.

“High praise from The Stump,” the Sifu replied.

Jee’s scarred face contorted with suppressed rage. Grand General of Koryo, Jee Yong-sun curated an air of eccentric brutality. Her nickname, “The Stump”, she gave freely to the newest of recruits. All but the savviest would laugh upon hearing it. They quickly, often painfully and exhaustingly too, learned it referred to her stubbornness, tenacity, and neigh indestructibility. In her time, Jee had been hacked, burned, and battered, and was now as gnarled as her namesake. Turning wilds into edge-land, edge-land into something starting to look like civilization had earned her stars and scars alike.

“But the *agar*, Sifu,” said Vizier Daewoo, “a new, all-but-forgotten supply. The Zhongguo had barely established trade. You know well as…” she hesitated, eyes darting to Sun and Hye, “as well as I, as the General and her grace, that we need it.”

“I’m here for them,” Sifu Advika, “not any of you. Should the entire New Joseon crumble around us, I do not care.”

“Sifu!” Sun almost hissed, scandalized. It wasn’t treasonous, but it was close.

“Advika,” the Vizier, somber, “her grace is asking for your aid. She is not ordering you—”

“I know she isn’t. She cannot.”

“Admitted,” the Vizier strained, “As you said, you are to teach the girls to make the world better one day. It will be hard to do that from a third-tier member of a second-tier superpower.”

The old woman shrugged, “Power doesn’t make the world better.”

“Allow me to be more blunt, Advika. The Continuum is not what it once was.”

“Vizier,” warned the General.

"Jee, please, I earned my position as much as you. The scars politics leaves are less visible, but no less painful to acquire, no faster to heal. Your battlefield is out there, claiming the Mongolian edge-lands from the Zhongguo, keeping the Drifters off our shores. I do not tell you where to place battalions, nor where to send our spies, human or otherwise. Yet their information is *mine.* It is for *me* to choose where and how to deploy it. 

Sun, Hye, you need to hear this as well. No doubt your Sifu has inferred it—she is aggravating that way—but the Peace is failing and we are on the losing side of the equilibrium of power. The Continuum falls further and further behind and Koryo is more weight than engine. Sun, you wish to rule one day? To be selected? Well then convince your Sifu to help make sure there is a Koryo when it is time.”

The Viceroy laughed, "Yes, young Seong-ma. Please, help us convince your Sifu. While we are being honest about things: your chances of Selection are, as of now, too small to merit calculation. Want to be the *next* Viceroy? You'd be amazed by the favors the *current* Viceroy can grant."

“Sifu,” Sun turned, but too was silenced by her rearer’s raised hand.

“No campaigning. This is campaigning.”

"I just wish I could go at all," said Hye, lost in thought, "I'd do the negotiations myself for a chance to see an arcology. To see the edge-lands."

“Hyeon,” said the Vizier, “I appreciate the offer, but these are delicate situations, not for tourism. Your sister has the training, and as a true Progeny could be a representative. But the idea is—”

Vizier Daewoo quieted. The Viceroy had sat forward, a marginal movement.

"You've hit upon something there, Vizier Daewoo. Once again your council proves as actionable as wise. Princess Seong-ma, *you* shall conduct the negotiations with the Olgoi-Khorkhoi Arcology. How often I have heard that you have been trained by this *master* in all things state craft. Yet you have been unable to put those campaign claims to the test. We must rectify that."

Sun moved a subtle hand to Hye’s knee and gripped it. Whether it was in excitement or terror, Hye didn’t know. She didn’t dare look away from the Viceroy. Don’t react, don’t give anything away. Heat ran under her skin, a shimmer of sweat would be her only tell.

“Your majesty,” said the Sifu, “you—”

"You've spoken, Sifu. You have declined. Understood, accepted. You *are* correct, I cannot order you about. This conversation no longer requires you. But my Progeny? My *Ward*? They I can command, absolutely, at my pleasure and whim. Should I not foster growth in my fledglings? I should and shall. Ward Hyeon, you shall accompany her. Separating the two of you is difficult enough and as I have my councilor, so too the Princess shall have hers. Brief them, General. Sifu, you are dismissed, but of course, grant you leave to observe the briefing and, should you find it relevant, to join them in their journey, though I'm sure Stump here can keep them quite safe without you."

The General nodded, “Of course, my grace. Feel free to treat this as a vacation, Sifu. I’m sure your old bones could use a rest.”

“Excellent,” said the Viceroy. 

“We depart within the hour,” said General Jee, quelling any debate. 

“General, see that Hyeon and Seong-ma are properly outfitted. It will be their first time in the edge-lands and I would prefer them back in one piece. Should the Sifu deign to accompany, she can sort herself. Dismissed. No not you Daewoo. Stay, we’ve other matters to attend.”

They stood to leave.

“And Seong-ma, get me agar, you’ll get your boon. Fail and you get nothing from me. You’ll have to pray the next Viceroy is more generous. Luck help you.”
