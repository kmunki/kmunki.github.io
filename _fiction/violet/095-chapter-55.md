Regret, that emotion of the spineless, had somehow snuck its way into Illapa’s brain. Action requires mistakes, and better to have acted and wished one had not then the other way. Yes, she thought, do not regret acting. 

With much fervor and gusto she thought this thought. 

Its efficacy was remarkably diminished, however, by the crashing and denting of the refrigerator door. Can of beans having proven insufficient, she had enlisted Msizi and the Ambassador in reinforcing the damaged door with the shelving all around them. At first, this endeavor had proven successful in small, but relevant, ways. When the enraged creature outside smashed its now bone and tooth encrusted fist into the door, it buckled less, though rattled a good deal more. Moreover, when it did break through, a disturbing but inevitable consequence of its onslaught, there would be several additional seconds where it would be forced to claw through the shelving. 

I might be reaching, she considered, too hard for a silver lining here.

Had she been in harder situations? It was hard to say.

“Are we going to die?” Msizi asked.

“No I suspect not,” said Illapa, her own confidence in the moment startling even her as she braced another girder against the door. “It’s changed its behavior. It stopped cooking, it’s now just gulping broth. We rattled it.”

“How is that good for us?”

“When you’re in a position of power, you take your time, you act as you please. There is a lot of…” Illapa hesitated to say meat, “It would have kept cooking and binging were all going according to whatever profane plan or malignant intent it possessed. Now it’s just angry.”

Another wall shaking smash and the door buckled further. Screeching, rending metal was followed by a subtler sound, one that continued after the rent stainless steel of door and shelves settled. It was a gasping, almost gargling sound. With it came that warm, tantalizing scent that drew saliva unwillingly from their ducts. There was a hole. Not a large one, perhaps gap is the better word. Where the door had buckled in, where the indentation met the frame, a space the size of a fist had opened up. Eyes, one blood shot and wild, the others, deformed and wriggling at the tips of disjointed fingers, stared through that hole. Then came a far worse sound. Laughter, like a hacksaw through a carcass, each ragged outward breath dragging against the ruined vocal cords and deformed tubing that kept the thing alive.

Far worse now, it was so much worse. A second set of teeth, misgrown and arbitrarily arranged, had breached its gums, doubling its horrific rictus. It stared at her, she it, as if they were attempting to read the others mind. Getting no where, with a sudden burst of resolution, it backed up and returned to the pot, where it once again quaffed great mouthfuls of broth, the rest, scalding hot, splashed on its arms and chest. Blisters formed instantly, swollen purple white.

“Snake feathers it doesn’t seem to feel pain. Everything it’s doing would be crippling to any creature with pain receptors. It’s probably breaking its bones with every charge. I’m not sure how many of those hits we can take.”

“What do we do? What do we do!?”

The ambassador, Eshma, was in full panic, insisting she was too young to die, that this was not how this was supposed to be going, and by god she, Illapa, she was a spy wasn’t she? What was that gun good for if not shooting the thing? Shoot it! Shoot! Where were the reinforcements? Hadn’t they called for help? Monologuing her own anxiety seemed to neither assuage nor activate her fellow captives.

“Sorry darling,” said Illapa in a *what are you gonna do? *tone, “this,” she held up her pistol, “is meant for killing humans. That out there isn’t any more. I’d just punch a few holes in it and make it angry.”

“It’s acting like one now,” said Msizi, bobbing and weaving her head, using the window and the opening to get a perspective on the creature. “I think it’s trying to find something”

Illapa pushed past her and looked. Sure enough, it was going through cabinets, not randomly or chaotically, but with simple, boring intent. For the first time in hours she was able to get a look at the whole of it. It had grown further still; a true abomination. What should have taken months of growth had been accomplished in days. Where there once had been a small, healthy man who seemed to enjoy his job helping wary ambassadors come to terms and leave his care slightly less likely to kill one another, there was now a hulking monstrosity, deformed and deranged by…

By what exactly? She had seen no cause. The symptoms were close enough to the rabid madness of a fury, but this was something else entirely, something far worse. And furies were war-relic, meaning…meaning this was as well. I have all the luck, thought Illapa. War-relics had been popping up with discomforting frequency these days. In the days since Brand had died and– *and *since she started her own mission. Whatever was happening was related to Violet. To the missing girls and their tutor. All of it tied together somehow. Were they here? Violet? The girls? Both? It made no sense.

A wrenching metal sound pulled her back to the moment at hand.

On the far side of the kitchen the ghul had ripped a huge wall pipe free. Water was pouring feely from the rent hole. The pipe looked heavy. Strong. The ghul had preserved the pipe’s elbow joint, which would create an unfortunate amount of leverage. It dragged the pipe across the floor with mutilated glee. In a single, intentional sweep it shoved the bent end of the pipe into the gap it had created and began to pry. The door was heavy, thick steel and, though it protested, it gave and the hole widened. The pipe was removed and a miserable, mutated arm was thrust through. Msizi, close enough to feel it sweep through the air, brought her own makeshift weapon down upon it. It was a part of a shelf, not much better than a spear, the one end bent into a sharp hook. It hit and embedded. The creature’s arm did not react, nor did the creature, save for pausing, as though it were startled. It drew the arm back out, with Msizi’s weapon still embedded. No longer just blood, but a host of fluids leaked from the thing. Blood, black and clotted, flowed out of it in clumps like spoilt milk. Intermixed were the yellow-green-pale oozing of a wound where the immune system is fighting a loosing battle. The smell was overwhelming, like roadkill after four hours in the blazing sun, both septic and caustic.

“We’re going to die here, aren’t we?”

Illapa, looked at her, then back to the door. Msizi saw a little bit of disappointment, but no disagreement. 

“You’re not wrong, but don’t go saying it out loud. And don’t go asking me as if I have a better answer.”
