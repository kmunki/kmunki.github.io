How mad have you gone? Illapa asked herself. As soon as she was clear of the crowd, she broke into a sprint. Buy time, buy time. The first half of her plan was working. She daren’t look back, but she didn’t need to. Deep in her primal brain, she felt herself hunted—the asura pursued. As with the Olokun she bet, once again, on the asura and fear. This time, however, it was not the fear she caused but that she held.

“Are you sure she’s dead?”

A simple enough phrase, an obvious enough question, but one she hoped haunted the asura enough to distract. Illapa ran into the residence and tore past the still smoldering corpses. The bulk of the ghul half buried the charred wreckage of the impossibly old asura. Hideyo had thought her Sifu dead once before. Illapa  had to hope doubt nagged enough for her to return. As she rounded the top of the stairs, she ventured a look over the bannister to see the living asura standing astride the corpse of the dead one.

A gunshot rang out. Then another.

“You do not come back this time, Sifu.”

Illapa saw her put two more rounds into the corpse’s chest, then aim again at the head. Illapa ducked into her room, grabbing the coffin-sized suitcase. She heard more gunshots. A standard magazine holds twelve.

“Inka!” Hideyo shouted. “Come out and join her. I do not wish to drag you out.”

Illapa hurled the coffin over the balustrade then fired two rounds, one deliberately missing, the second grazing the asura’s arm. With frightening speed she dove out of the way.

“Oh you will die slow, I promise you this.”

Hideyo ran towards the stairs with speed that confounded Illapa. Her shots were wide, late. How could anyone move that fast. Oh gods what a dumb plan this was. Illapa leaped over the balustrade just as Hideyo arrived, spine at the ready. She turned and fired, desperate to keep the asura pinned for a moment longer. She landed hard and rolled. The asura would be right behind.

Then she heard it. A celebratory roar from the crowd.

Mid-air, the asura heard it too. She landed in a run.

“No!” The woman in black shouted, “no no no!” And she was gone, back to the fight. The doors of the residence were still splayed open, a slab of sunset framing the monsters’ bodies.

Illapa knew she had minutes before the woman would come back, ready for vengeance. With all her strength, she pulled the old Sifu’s charred corpse from under the wendigo’s and placed it into the coffin.

“Vidya has theories about whatever you were Sifu. Even as a corpse, you’re too valuable to Violet, which means you’re valuable to Inka.”

She crawled in next to the body.

“Gods I hope this thing doesn’t kill me too.”

“Not if I kill you first,” said Hideyo, who had appeared again in the door.

“Sorry love, not this time!”

Illapa snapped the lid shut and smashed the only button in the coffin. A terrible roar as the rockets blasted to life and the coffin launched through the doors. Tiny wings popped out of the sides, fore and aft, and it hurled itself into the air. A perfect parabola through the sky of Seoul, out towards the sea.
