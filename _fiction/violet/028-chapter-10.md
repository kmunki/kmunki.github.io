Agent Illapa braced herself and took her morning sip of coffee. Would this accursed nation ever figure out how to brew it well? Her hope was waining. The Inka were, what was it, twice as far from Ethiopia and yet had mastered the little bean’s cultivation and consumption in half the time? It was little wonder England’s little foray into India backfired badly enough that the whole of the subcontinent was conquered.

A small light on her desk began to blink, accompanied by a gentle chime. Well then, it seemed the excitement would start early today. Unwilling to surrender to the tepid bilge in her mug, she carried it through the hall, up the elevator to the top floor, and stood outside the Office of the Director of Intelligence for the European Security Agency. The building was steeped in old world charm, wood paneling, oil paintings of serious individuals in absurd garments, and fine glass work. It would all have been rather lovely were it not coated by a veneer of desperate nostalgia, clinging to every surface like soot. Shame, that. 

She depressed the button outside the Director’s double door. A pause, then a tone and a click. The outer-door swung open, revealing a second door, wrapped in tufted maroon leather. She opened it. A crystal glass half full of whiskey shattered on the wall to her left as she did.

“Bad morning, Director?” Illapa asked as she took her seat. There was the slightest *thip* sound as the door closed itself and sealed. What had been an office was now an isolated box in which nothing left unless the occupants decided it should.

Ursine Müller, a great bear of a woman, crushed her cigar into a near-empty water glass where it hissed along side its fallen brethren. She sized up the Inkan, another unwanted guest in her office. Illapa was lean, wiry muscle beneath field-ready posture. Ursine knew she had stims and acid for blood, having grown up in Cuzco, and had earned more medals than most juntas can even invent. She ran field ops like a kind of beloved philosopher-despot. Her teams would follow her anywhere and had the passport stamps from Hell to prove it.

"Fuck!" she yelled, then incredulous, to Illapa added, “Even English profanity isn't helping.” She put a cigarette to her lips and lit it.

Already in the room, lurking like a swarthy ghost, was Vidya Garuda, Chief of Staff. Thiruvananthapuram-born, Oxbridge educated, barely out of basic in the Royal Navy before assigned to the ESA, Vidya should have been more of a pain than an asset. Greener than the Kingdoms’ flag, but she could draw it from memory and translate it into seven other languages. The bastard child of anthropology, behavioral economics, historians, and military tacticians, she not only usually guessed which revolutions, secessions, and unions would succeed, but what their flags, mottos, and political parties would be. An odd choice for the UKK to send to their little territory. Then again, she, Illapa, was here.

"Brand is dead," said Ursine, punctuating with her cigarette. "Executed, then dumped. We dredged him up mid-ocean."

“Spying is dangerous,” said Illapa, “getting caught is often fatal.”

“Yes,” added Vidya, “But there had been a knowing wink to the game. An understanding. Tooth in his *pocket*, though, that was a message; the extra shots were needless flourish.”

“These goddamn tech upstarts don't give a shit. What are we going to do about Violet, Garuda?” she said, then took a drag.

"Those are bad for you, mum." Vidya's was the classic blended Indian-English accent of the Keralan upper-crust.

"Ah, *quatsch*, Garuda,” her own French-Swiss gave the Austrian profanity a dismissal flair. She been smoking long before everyone was realizing you probably shouldn't. Even now, behind a desk for a decade, it was funny how mere memories of being shot at tended to cause warnings about cancer and emphysema to fade into the background. Everything was a risk-reward calculation. Everything. Running a secret agency for the last-place runner-up in the world superpower game and having flicked a few too many dangerous people in the metaphorical nose over the years had lead her to believe that it would not be natural causes for her. She was well past the half-century mark. Everything after that was bonus time.

She poured herself a drink for the hell of it.

"Fair enough, mum." Vidya shifted in her seat.

Ursine squinted at her, inhaling slowly and then blasting it out her nostrils as she said, "You've got no fucking clue, do you." She ashed into her cigar butt-filled water glass, "shit."

Vidya angled her head, looking up and to the right, as if the thought were in the corner of the ceiling, “I’ve always a clue. But not quite enough, yet. Corporate sovereignty is complex. The rules are new. It's reminding everyone that..." she paused, searching.

Like most true intelligence spooks, Vidya was creepy and charismatic, a near vampire. Illapa swore she floated when no one was watching. She could probably send her shadow out for tea. Her eyes and ears were everywhere and were loyal because she kept them hidden and alive. Also, possibly, under a thrall. 

"Anarchy," said Illapa, finishing the sentence. "Violet's new Sovereignty is reminding everyone that there is no law among nations. Treaties and alliances, sure, but no law. Nation-states exist in anarchy relative to each other. A corporation is just a form of economic organization and management. We're just not used to seeing them overlap with a national system of governance."

"Post-communist China was," Vidya frowned and corrected, "is still run like—”

"Yes, *like*," Illapa added, anticipating her point, "Zhongguo is *like—*.

"Like a corporation," Vidya said, soldiering on, "but not *as* one. This is, as you put it, new." 

"Enough," said Ursine, sitting up and waving her hand to silence them as both went to speak. "Debate in your spare time, something I sorely doubt any of us have. Brand is dead," she whipped her terminal display around and swiped through the photos of the sea-bloated corpse. "We have three, maybe four agents who can handle this. Whatever the fuck *this*,” she waved at the air, "actually is. No one seems to know. But the Inka are freaking out—but we knew that already or you, our friend from Condor,” she stabbed her cigarette at the air in the direction if Illapa, “wouldn’t be here. The Kingdoms are sending in their own people, not to mention the Chinese and the Malians, and, of course, no one in the Valley gives a shit because they suspect if Li Xing is doing something to piss this many people off she's probably on to The Next Big Thing. But!" Ursine sat back again, taking a drag, "but the edges are wrong. It's different this time around. She didn't kill Brand as an over-reaction. It was, as you put it, Garuda, a message."

She looked at them expectant.

“Brand was one of the best, but he was also a bit out of date. That's my fault," said Garuda, her gaze drifting up as she inhaled through her nose sharply, "his death is on me. He was the wrong agent and it was wrong to send him in alone. But! My information pointed to Brand as the best option. Let us be blunt: the Keralans sent* *in a European for a reason. A diabolical one—Europeans don’t matter. This is old history but it warrants repeating. Brand was our best and in your newly conquered* *position, you were the last player without your hands tied. Failure was all too likely an option and since we’re not all signing up for fatigues and a rehash of basic tells me it was the right call. The man was a blunt instrument, but he needed to be!" Garuda gestured with clenched fists, implying profanity. "It's all circumstantial, but the indicators of a power play are there. Li Xing is doing *something *she shouldn't." She sat back, deflated with preaching to the choir, "I'd stake my career on it," she added, half to herself.

"You always say that," said Illapa.

"I have to. Wouldn't be much good at my job if I didn't."

The Inkan ceded the point with a nod.

“Agreed," said Illapa, "Li Xing is pushing to make Violet more than it is. It might be at Uplift, might be something else entirely. But she's outside the normal rules. That's the message."

"And the tech community love her for it," added Vidya. "She's not entirely wrong."

"Terrible people rarely are," added Illapa. "It's always about the means. You can end world hunger by killing all the starving people, Vidya. Zero-sum is easy." Ursine chuckled and raised her eyebrows at Vidya, Illapa had her there. "Anyway," Illapa continued, "Brand is gone. Did we *get *anything?”

Ursine brightened. “Yes.”

“What?” Vidya Garuda blustered. She was never not the first to know.

“My mesh trap caught it,” she held up the little communicator, wiggling it and her eyebrows in tandem. “He snapped at least two photos which hitchhiked their way across the ocean with a Kingdom ambassador who I just happened to be stuck with on some awful committee about committees. The stupid shit I have to do now. Garuda do you want to be Director?”

“Someday,” she said, wistful.

Ursine grumbled, “Point is, I was flagged as a terminal node. Total fluke I ended up with them before you, Garuda. I think *that* makes me happier than the photos themselves. I assume more but his watch and the film weren’t on the corpse, but I think we could send some divers or—“

“Would you please show us!?” said Vidya, exasperated.

Ursine squinted and took a long drag on her cigarette, locking eyes with the Keralan. 

“Fine.”

For a long time, they just stared at the photos. No one spoke.

On the screen was a diskette and a paper with a list. A list of names. Grainy, dark, a bit blurry and pixelated, some compression noise and the angle weren’t great. The symbol on the disk and the list were, however, legible.

“I don’t know what the fuck any of this is,” Ursine said, breaking the silence.

“Those symbols are old,” said Vidya, “I’ll need time.”

“Who are the names?” Illapa asked.

“Soon to be very important people,” said Vidya, “Of those I can read, more than a few are up-and-coming in their fields. A couple are overrated—what gets mistaken for art is a tragedy—some are genuine geniuses in obscure, odd areas. And, *hmmmm” s*he scratched her chin and leaned in, “yes a few of these are scions or royals. Young. Names haven’t been made yet but are getting attention.”

Illapa stood to leave, “Capture and interrogate? We can have the first few in custody before end of day.”

“God no!” said Ursine, “Sit! Sit sit sit,” ashes and sparks flying from the cigarette as she gestured. “The situation is hot. We don’t know what this list is. Targets? Collaborators? Potential hires—Garuda just wait I’m being rhetorical, I know you have thoughts—*you don’t know*. We won’t soon either. We need to *watch, to learn*. We need intel so we can have a theory that is built on more than two contextless grainy photos shuttled through the ether on the dying wish of a dead spy.”

“Besides the Keralans won’t go for another op,” said Vidya.

“Yes that too,” acknowledged Ursine, frowning.

“Who then?” asked Illapa, “We’re thin as it is. Tailing two dozen almost-somebodies is more than your team can handle. They’re good, sure, but that scale even *with *permission and support is hard to conceal.”

“Well I have a thought there too,” said Ursine, a glint in her eye, “I know this one—Kimia Air, the Persian physicist. Well her mother.”

“You know the former Prime Minister of Persia?” asked Illapa.

“They dated,” said Vidya, “at academy.”

Ursine shrugged. “She was hot and smart. I was charismatic and bold.”

“Who ended it?” asked Illapa.

“The plan!” said Ursine, slamming her hands on the desk. Vidya made a face of understanding. Ursine continued, “Her daughter, Kimia, runs their national laboratories and is in the process of spinning out a state corporation.”

“Rumblings are it’s got a real chance at putting Violet and Condor, among others, on the back foot. Something about agar in zero grav. But this list isn’t just competitors and the company is barely formed. I’m not seeing the connection,” said Vidya, quizzical.

“Yes yes, I’m getting there,” said Ursine. “Violet out maneuvered us because it is both a nation and, more importantly here, a *corporation*. When one hand is tied, often the other is not.”

“An advantage we now have,” said Vidya, brightening, “Brand’s body was destroyed as a message. They know we know. But the images are still *our* secret. No one beyond this room knows that *we know* that they exist, or their contents. I *do *love informational asymmetry.”

Ursine, relieved, expelled a massive sigh of smoke and whiskey vapor.

“The Keralan Minister of the European Dominion called this morning,” continued Vidya, “Brand’s death puts them in a sub-optimal position vis-a-vis trade with Violet. They’re worried the Maharani might even lose her board seat. Viro is on her way to the meeting right now. We are up to our necks in trouble. But Illapa, you—”

“I’m not part of the UKK. Not officially,” she completed the thought, “My presence here is almost as secret as that,” she pointed to the list on the screen.

“You can move independently, on behalf of Condor. Unwelcome,” Vidya held the idea in one hand, then looked at the other, “but in an *expected* way. Your movements, those few that are detected, will be understood as bland corporate espionage; one Sovereignty against another. It’s a brilliant stratagem, Director Müller.”

She took a drag from her cigarette and smokily agreed, “It is.” 

“However,” Vidya continued, “with Violet having shown its intent, there is another problem we must consider…” She stared into space, haunted by her own thought.

“Garuda!” Ursine barked.

“Yes. Apologies. The asura,” Vidya said, the hairs on her neck and arms rising as she did.

“An asura?” Illapa hissed.

“They are much rarer now,” said Vidya, unsettled, “but the few that are left are, well, all the more exceptional. Hideyo Hirohito is, among even these, a truly disturbing specimen. She is often seen in public with Li Xing, so what we do know is that she is, ostensibly, ethnically Japanese. The only confirmed physical manifestations of the asura process are her ink-black iris and sclera. Her right arm is synthetic, regrown around a biomechanical frame with a chitin-plasticine shell, creating the appearance of a permanent gauntlet. The rest is rumors.”

“Well come on, even half-truths might help here, out with it,” said Ursine.

“Most plausible are that she is venomous. Vector unknown, speculations about limbs. Ōgumo tech is theorized to both suffuse her synthetic arm and a custom subcutaneous endo-frame that attaches to her spine and hips, further augmenting her already not insubstantial strength.”

“An ogumo asura?” Illapa asked through gritted teeth, disbelieving.

“Ōgumo *tech*. Asura are too valuable to risk the, erm, aggressive symbiosis of the armor. Regarding her relationship with Li Xing, that pre-dates Violet. She, Okafor, and Li Xing formed an early triumvirate. Hirohito’s military and secrets access allowed war-relic research to out pace that of most other private entities, while Okafor and Li Xing’s drive and brilliance allowed them to out perform more, ah, bureaucratic institutions. How they met precisely is an open question, with speculation ranging from childhood friends to secret societies.

Like all asura, she is the primary threat in any scenario and should not be directly confronted, even at a ten to one ratio.”

Illapa stared stone-faced at Vidya for a moment, then Ursine. She stood, and tugged at her jacket, straightening it.

“Finally,” she said, a massive grin forming, “a real mission. So where do I start?”

“Nairobi,” said Vidya, “Uplift.”

Illapa bellowed with laughter. “You are joking.”

“I would never,” said Vidya. “Almost all of the names on that list *might *be there, several almost certainly will be! Condor Moray, Violet, all the biggest corporations will be in the Rift Valley for a week. Kimia Tir is certain to be among them. Should you be, ah, noticed—”

“I won’t be,” said Illapa, flat.

“Yes, of course,” said Vidya, “but should you be, Condor is a regular attendee. Your presence wouldn’t raise an eyebrow.”

“More than that,” added Ursine, “there will be delegations from most of the major players on the national stage. They’re either board members, buyers, or suppliers. Half the world economy runs through that parade of self-important speeches and all-night parties. The chance that someone with this list isn’t thinking the same thing about Uplift is low. It’s our opening.”

“Don’t worry Illapa,” said Vidya, “much of it is illegal and illicit. As many mobsters and dealers attend as ministers and diplomats. You’ll fit right in.”

“So I won’t be the only one with a gun?” Asked Illapa.

“Not by a long shot. Bring all your toys and you’ll still be underdressed compared to some of the entourages that’ll be there, above board and below.”

“Well then I best get packing. Vidya, I’ll need another briefing on what the hell to look for once I’m there.”

“Good. Excellent, everyone out of my office,” said Ursine. They stood to leave and as Illapa opened the door Ursine added, “Remember. The rules have changed. Violet changed them. Assume nothing. That goes for all of you.”

They each nodded and walked out, closing the door behind them, leaving Ursine alone with her  poisons of choice.
