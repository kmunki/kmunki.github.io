Waiting at the dock in Busan was the Olokun’s ship, the *Chombo. *Hours prior, Illapa had delivered the moto, but stayed herself until she was sure she had no tail. Two heavily armed macaques eyed her as she strode up the gang plank. She held out her talisman, waived it in the pass-gesture, then mentioned the mission password as she got into range. The guards relaxed, waving her onboard. Just beyond was Biby, wringing her hands and looking from one macaque to another. The ship began to pull out of the harbor as Illapa, their sole reason for docking, followed the lemur below deck.

When the *Chombo* was first broached as transport from Koryo, the Inkan agent had asked with half-veiled sarcasm, “Why does great creature of the sea, a borderline aquatic demigod, need an ocean craft?” 

The orca had responded with a curt, “Do you walk everywhere?”

But the real answer, Illapa realized, was the crew. The Olokun had hundreds of agents: crows, lemurs, cats, bats, and more than a few humans. For an operation primarily ‘peopled’ with hybrids, Illapa had been forced into grudging respect. The *Chombo *was massive, state-of-the-art, beautiful, and run with military precision. Though there was still too much squawking and chirruping for her taste, a ship-as-headquarters was a savvy move. Agents need a forward operations base and, often enough, a good fast get away. As a matter of precaution, the orca had explained, business was conducted in the open ocean whenever possible. Hence, the *Chombo* was rarely at rest.

Biby lead Illapa into a vast work area in the center hull of the craft. There were several work stations, with partial bulkheads dividing them, filled with humans and hybrids engaged in intelligence work. Though she had been on military craft before, the dimensions of the catamaran created an impressive effect of making the inside seem larger than the outside. Exaggerating this was the subtle movement of the horizon outside the windows. She followed the lemur to a space separated from the main area by sliding paneled walls. Inside were Vidya, a grey parrot, and one of the Olokun’s scientists, as well as the findings from the palace. 

“Wonderful,” said Vidya, “welcome back, Illapa. Illapa, this,” she indicated the parrot, “is Iskandra, the Olokun’s proxy. Iskandra, Illapa.”

“Pleasure,” said Illapa with a forced smile.

“For you, yes. For me, we shall see,” said Iskandra, “On this ship, I command. I’ve heard about your reputation—“

“Vidya! How hurtful,” said Illapa, feigning insult.

“There it is. As promised,” said Iskandra, irritated. She clacked across the table with a head-bobbing walk. “You Inka seem *still *to think hybrids are helpers, not peers. I am stopping that mistake. This,” the bird tilted their head to the side. Illapa could see, just within the flared feathers, a glitter of wire, “is war-relic tech. *We* adapted it. From our *other* findings. The Archivist and our analysts created it. I’m no uplift, but I’m close. Know that. Much as you dislike having a hybrid in charge, that is your situation.”

“As you’ve articulated,” said Vidya, attempting to defray the tension, “we’re on your ship.”

“And so, am ranking officer and in command.”

“On the boat you, off the boat me,” said Illapa.

“And where are we?” Said the parrot, as if speaking to a toddler.

“My goodness I hope on the boat”

The parrot stood, staring, patient.

“Aye, mu’m-ji” said Vidya, all but vibrating with discomfort, “we understand.”

“Fully at your service,” said Illapa, arch, “pecking order clear!”

“Captain, shall I?” Said the scientist, interjecting.

“Yes, Onosaʻi, what has our insouciant Inkan brought us?” 

“Agent Illapa,” said the scientist in greeting, “I have a question first.”

She had the thin, exhausted build stereotypical of ilk. Her long, straight black was hair pulled back, more out of the way than in any particular style. To Illapa, she appeared Polynesian—though which islands was unclear. Intricate purple tattoos, whirls, squares, dots, and bands, covered her skin. 

“You had our crew load aboard a moto, a case, and a segment of armor, and a patch.”

Illapa nodded.

“Why?”

Illapa debriefed them: the seditious guard, the hidden compartment in the old woman’s hut, the battle damaged garage, her glorious departure.

“The moto itself was”—Illapa smiled at the thought—“*is* a masterpiece. Serpent feathers, it is fast. I, well, I’m somewhat ashamed to admit this but even I was wary to open her up all the way. Between Pyongyang and Seoul there was a straight stretch. The, well,” again, Illapa found herself almost laughing, “it was so fast. Even pressed close to it I could feel the wind resistance pulling at me and the vibration in the handlebars. Whomever had piloted this in its hey day must have been…” Illapa whistled, at a loss.

“Must have been a war-relic themselves, as these are.”

“All of it?” Vidya asked, incredulous.

Onosaʻi nodded. “Save the patch. Moto and case near the end of the war. Far beyond anything I’ve ever seen. The moto frame is woven chitin. *Grown* that way. Exceptionally light and strong. No known record of the material or its manufacture.” 

“At least one recovery from the Last Days here, then,” said Vidya, eager.

“Property of Condor, of course,” said Illapa.

“Easy, Illapa,” said Vidya, “the Keralan-Inkan agreement, amended to include the Olokun, gives us *all* access.” 

“We get first commercial rights.”

Iskandra fluttered to the moto and landed on the tip of the cantilevered seat. 

“And *we* get shadow market,” said Iskandra,  bobbing her head and glaring at the Inkan agent.

The scientist was looking at all three with open disdain and shock.

“Let me reiterate,” said Onosaʻi, curt, “this moto is not any war-relic. It’s likely one-of-a-kind; so secret that its records were destroyed upon creation. What you casually rode five-hundred kilometers like it was some rental, Agent, might be the discovery of the decade.”

Illapa bowed with exaggerated pomp. “You’re welcome.”

“Unbelievable. Well then,” squawked the parrot, “the rest?”

“Let’s move to the second finding: the case. We were able to open with a secondary key within the fob. As I said, the moto might be the discovery of the decade. This case’s contents might be as well. It contains a vajra rail.”

“A vajra!” Vidya lunged forward to see, astounded.

Onosaʻi opened the case. Illapa placed a hand on the display table, steadying herself, her knees suddenly weak. Gods above and below, a vajra rail.

“You’re certain?” Said Vidya, a skeptical hand hovering, afraid to touch it. “Even our own archive only has a handful, and *we* invented it.”

“You have fewer than that,” said Iskandra. 

Vidya’s eyes bugged. 

“Why is this hard to grasp?” Pressed the parrot, annoyed. “The Olokun deals in information. I am one of her seconds. I know more than you want me to, than you think it’s possible for me to know. And the Olokun knows more than *that*. The point, here, is that I *agree *with the Indian. I trust you, Onosa’i, but I am skeptical.”

“Well this is a first,” said Illapa, “I agree with the bird.”

The Polynesian scientist nodded, forbearing.

“A fair concern. There are several elements rumored to have been part of the vajra pistols. Vidya, the Keralan archives only contain, from my understanding, limited prototypes that have one or two of these capabilities, correct?”

“Yes,” the Keralan answered through her teeth.

“Here, we have a weapon that not only possesses some, but all of those, and exemplary at that. For example, the entire weapon, not simply the barrel or slide, is osso-ceramic.” 

She lifted the bone-white weapon from its case with reverence, then presented it to Illapa on open palms. Illapa lifted it from her hands and gasped. Not cool, like metal, but room temperature, almost warm, and light, half the weight of her pistol. She held it, aimed at the floor, pulling the slide back, then returned it to the case.

“Osso-ceramic is a known material,” Vidya said.

“Not like this,” said Illapa, the thrill of holding the weapon running through her like voltage.

“Precisely,” continued Onosa’i, “the cost and complexity of manufacturing even a barrel of this quality is beyond our best theorized techniques. To have an entire weapon is, speaking freely, unimaginable. Were this weapon not in my hands I would not believe it existed. As you can see, the reliefs are of spectacular beauty.”

“Are these…” Vidya’s sentence trailed, her hand running over the intricate images carved into the weapon. Along it were motifs of nature: vines, flowers, branches, leaves, thorns, and seeds. Among and within them were other weapons: long-bows, war-hammers, swords. Along the top a single magnificent club was centered: the vajra, holy bones made godly weapon. It was double-ended with clawed club heads. From each stretched gemmed lightning. The bolts were inlayed with diamonds, not only clear and white, but yellow, red, blue, each placed with artisanal eye to, with the subtlest tilting, cause them to flash, as though a live charge coursed through the wielder’s hand.

“Celestial weapons,” said Illapa, finishing Vidya’s sentence, “divine arms that fought and won the wars of legend.” She looked up, explaining now to the parrot and Keralan, “Sigils. Totems. As the war progressed, belief in, not magic, not precisely, but of harmonic and immaterial elements of the universe was interwoven with science and reason.”

“Exactly right,” said the scientist, “your agent here is well read,” she said, addressing the parrot, “arrogant and reckless by reputation. In my short experience, the occasional churl. But with some erudition. To have acquired these relics is among the tallest feather in the Olokun’s crown. Where do you find such people?”

The parrot shrugged, “In this case, she found us. You’re doing the Inka proud, Agent Illapa ” said Iskandra, ignoring Illapa’s stunned, somewhat offended look. “Let’s continue. The armor segment? The patch?”

“Wait,” said Vidya, “how did the old Koryo rearer come into possession of these?”

“Gifts,” shrugged Illapa, placing the gun back in its case, “theft? War-relics are found all the time. She’s savvy, to have made it this long, and we know she has real training, so if I could manage it, chances are she could.”

“Or she is an asura,” said Iskandra.

Illapa and Vidya looked at the bird in shock. She gestured back to the scientist.

“The evidence,” said Onosa’i, “is purely speculative. However”—she tapped the shard—“this adds to that theory. The segment is a similar carbon-chitin alloy, but clearly natural, grown, primarily chitin. We believe it’s ogumo.”

“Ogumo!” Vidya sat, overwhelmed. Illapa’s face became stern.

“We’ve heard whispers they were not entirely gone,” said Iskandra, now glancing at Illapa.

Hands clasped behind her back, Illapa stared at the technician, then turned to the parrot. “A wise suspicion. Any military would be wary to lose such an asset, even in peace time.”

“Yes,” said Onosa’i, “deep freeze being the most obvious method. However, this shows no signs of the de-re hydration strains on the cellular walls. Moreover, isotopic decay would indicate recent growth, in at least the last twenty years. Given known storage and usage parameters.”

“It’s new,” said Illapa, “You’re saying it’s new. That someone is making *new* ogumo armor.”

Onosa’i nodded, “Yes.”

“Not only making, *using* it would seem. At the Koryo Summer Palace. And…” 

Vidya’s eyes darted around the room, compiling the analysis in real time. 

“An ogumo, even one, would have been more than a match for every single guard at the Palace, as well as a former assassin and her reared proteges. Or would be, were they simply *human*. But an asura . . . she’s old enough to have been active during the first revolutionary period, certainly during the second.”

“There is no count of asuras,” added Iskandra, “all the data is poor. Bits and pieces. Guesswork. Violet’s CIO is the only known post-war asura, and closest we have to known proof, and still,” she fluttered, frustrated, “just rumor.”

“We don’t know,” said Onosa’i, “but the signs indicate Advika Shidao is, if nothing else, an extraordinary former agent and that age has done little to slow her.” 

“And,” Vidya picked up the thread again, “given the attitude and the leaks from the Joseon’s Viceroy-elect, Yi Ji-woo, it would seem that there is substantially more interest in finding the Shidao and the Ward, Yi Hyeon Bong-cha than Seong-ma. They’re missing, unaccounted for. If it was an internal move in league with Violet to gather more from their list, as we suspect, it might have been a partial failure. The Ward and Sifu may have escaped.”

“Do we have any leads there?” Illapa asked.

“No,” said Iskandra, “only this,” she picked up the patch with a claw.

“The mercenaries it is then? Songhai?”

“Yes,” confirmed Onosa’i.

“Good news,” said the parrot, bobbing her head with delight, “I get to send you into harm’s way once again, Agent Illapa. You’ll be meeting with them in Nairobi.”

Illapa grinned, “And I get off this ship. A win-win, eh?”

Vidya was now pacing, touching the objects, almost manic, her subvocal mumblings punctuated by frustrated huffs and head scratching.

“We can’t… the strangeness of these discoveries… let’s retrace the path here. We were aware Violet was up to something— bad? —regardless, worth investigating. We send Brand. His death buys us two artifacts, photos of a list and a diskette. The list is of individuals of note. We track those. 

You”—she indicates Illapa—“find the Persian scientist, Tir, then lose her to Violet’s asura in Nairobi at Uplift. This validates the theory: Violet is collecting those on the list. By luck, you meet the lemur, Biby, then the Olokun. We ally. The Olokun learns of the Koryo attack—well before any other agency—so you’re first to the aftermath. This is all fairly unlikely as it is. Astoundingly, our luck continues. You find the old Sifu’s hidden cache. Within? Relics: a divine weapon and keys to an impossible vehicle. Now we’re speculating about asura. Real enough, but were it not for your encounter with Hideyo Hirohito, I would have said their abilities were vastly over stated and they no longer existed. And yet…” 

She tapped the moto seat, affirming its corporeality, then gestured to the gun. 

“Here is an object that should not exist. Not merely its material, but its composition, its quality, the beauty of the design and the detail of the inlay. But more than that, this is the White Weapon. It was wielded not just by any asura, but the first, the world-killer, Ananda. Some called it the Moon, because in her hands it changed the tides of battles. For others, that whiteness was skeletal; exposed bone, bleached in the sun. A vision of the wastelands it could create in her hands. Ananda, what a name, legendary herself. Holding this gun is, I’m not sure how to explain this any further, is like being handed a lightning bolt or watching someone reach up and pluck a star out of the night sky. This is like finding Arjuna’s bow, or your namesake’s warak’a and maqana. And where? In hidey-hole of an old woman who tutors two girls whose names were on the list Brand found.

Objective as I try to be, we are in a space beyond that. We’re up against the edges of the possible. An *uplift*, a *vajra*, that moto, ogumo, asura. My bedrock of reality is slipping.

Iskandra, Onosaʻi, I am no fool. Nor is Illapa here. We have conflicting goals. The Olokun is not the only one with exceptional information. The Inka and UKK have been sharing intelligence on you the instant you were brought to our attention. Your motives, while not transparent, are not impossible to determine. But that, like our mutual history, is, in this moment, irrelevant. We need your research and resources. You need our agents. Violet is our shared worry. Where our goals align for the time being, they align. No more or less.”

The parrot, agent, and scientist were quiet moment, still attempting to catch up to her logorrhea.

“My point, here, is that what we are wading into is more than Brand’s mission, more than even a crisis of global politics. History is shifting around us. If we’re looking over our shoulder the entire time, it is likely we will miss the Old Gods emerging from the Shadow right in front of us. Or, perhaps by accident we’ll unleash them, restarting the Long War a century after we thought it had ended.”

“I’m very careful,” said Illapa, picking up the patch and sliding it into her pocket, “back to Nairobi, it is then? Let me know when the plan is done.”

“Where are you going?”

“I’ve been on the road for hours, I’m for a bath and bed before I’m shot at again. Speaking of,” she said, slapping Vidya on the shoulder, ”don’t shoot me in the back while we’re making history. And make sure the bird doesn’t either, eh?”

She walked out of the room, waived down a crew member for directions to the state rooms.

Poking her head back into the room, she said, “And you,” pointing to Onosaʻi, “if you’d like to join for the bed, bath, or both, please do.”

She winked and was gone.
