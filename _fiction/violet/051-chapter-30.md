Their pace across the ice was hard and monotonous. There had been little to see. The Wilds, populated as they were, could still be empty for vast stretches. No matter the adaptations of the animals and hybrids, Siberian tundra in winter was a harsh, brutal place.

Perhaps three hours out, Advika slowed to a stop in the middle of the river while there was still some reserve charge. Bööm wriggled to be let out, as did Juju. Hye reached for her clasp but Advika stilled her hand. The Sifu pulled out a pair of binoculars and handed them to Hye. She gestured to a huge dark spot far off on the side of a low hill, perhaps a kilometer or two away. Amorphous, the spot shifted and moved, its edges blurry. Through the binoculars, Hye saw a huge herd of caribou. Among them were massive elk, doubling the height of their neighbors. Each loomed like a gargantuan sentinel, their erect heads well above the tops of the caribou antlers. Despite their hugeness, the antlers of the elks themselves seemed impossibly large. Starting from thick stalks, they spread into huge, moose-like paddles then ended in at least twenty of the classic grey-to-white points.

“Baikal Wapiti,” said Advika, “resurrected from the old extinct cervine stock. Colossal deer, taller at the shoulder than even Yukon moose by at least a foot. Thicker skeletons. Denser musculature. Far larger and stronger antlers.”

The titans roamed among their modern peers, watchful, knowing. Blasts of steam came from their nostrils. Hye caught a new movement, low, among and through the legs of the herd. One entered a small clearing: wolves, Siberian grays. Far to the edges of the herd, though, a second set of titans. Stoic, scanning the horizon, were wolves that were nearly the size of the elk themselves.

“There are dire wolves in there,” Hye said, not letting the binoculars waver. “Why aren’t they attacking? Why aren’t the elk… is that *whole thing* a swarm?”

“Yes. A herdpack,” said the Sifu. “A single ecosystem, hybridized and symbiotic. The wolves protect *and* eat the wapiti. They are shepherd and wolf.  The Baikal Wapiti and Dire — both extinct Ice Age species — are near human intelligence. Think of the dumbest of Jee’s sergeants. These are just a hair smarter. The scorwev swarm at the Olgoi was pure instinct; a herdpack scouts, plans, maneuvers. Look.”

The Sifu pointed at the forest edge. After a moment, Hye saw them, little flickers within the deep tree shadow.

“The herdpack is, like most swarms, able to operate on a kind of collective intelligence. Body language, scent, sounds, along with what are, in effect, lateral line whiskers that sense changes in air pressure, proximity, and temperature — it’s hard to say where the individuals end and group begins. Unlike most swarms, herdpacks have leaders, amplifying and guiding that group mind. Their scouts”—she nodded towards the woods—“operate in pairs or triples. What you saw in the woods are one set running to tell another before returning. Sometimes they’ll have dedicated runners.”

“We can’t camp here, can we?”

“No,” said the Sifu. “Had we stopped ten minutes ago, we’d have been fine, out of range and unseen. Now, we’ll need to put as much distance as possible. Hold on.”

Advika revved the throttle and they shot off down the river.

As they rounded the bend, Hye turned to look back. There, standing on the edges of both sides of the river, were several sets of wolves watching them depart. In the center of the ice, where their moto had been, was a single massive wolf, a dire, with a scar across one eye. Its lone eye held her gaze, evaluating, until they disappeared behind the trees.

Their luck held, however, and they rode on. Each time they paused to rest and recharge the batteries, Hye expected to catch movement in the trees. Feeling the eyes of some creature watching, she would peer into the woods or over her shoulder into the expanse of white, each time expecting to see the wolf, far off, staring back. But they were alone.

Near the end of the following day, they stopped to take advantage of the remaining light. They released the cinder hawks to hunt into an empty brilliant blue winter sky that held nothing but the low, hard, bright sun. Beneath it was the incandescent snow and shadowed forests. This would be their last push. Camp set, the fire burning, and perimeter established, they sat and ate, facing each other at angles, so they could easily see over the other’s shoulder. 

Hours passed. Each slept some. Batteries charged, they began to break camp.

Hye scanned the horizon for Juju. Where was she?

A flash of light caught her eye. Well up river, seemingly just above the trees. She tilted her head back and forth. There it was again. Not even a flash, a glint.

“Is that?” She half asked under her breath, squinting.

“Our destination, yes, the Tower,” said Advika, not looking up as she folded down their tent. She knew what had caught her student’s eye, “We’ll be there in the next three to four hours or so. That you can see it from here is a good sign its somewhat still intact. What we’ll find inside… of that I’m less sure. Your bird is back.” Advika lifted her head slightly to gesture over Hye’s shoulder. “Caught something.”

Juju glided down and, flaring just before she alighted, dropped something on the ice. She looked at Hye expectantly, stamping her feet and flexing her wings with excitement, her eager gaze jumping from her discovery to her doyen. *What is it? *Her head looking from the thing, to Hye, to the thing, to Hye. *Did I find something interesting? *As Hye approached, she thought it looked like three field mice huddled together.

“Oh!” said Hye, regarding the thing Juju had set on the snow.

“Something interesting?” Advika asked.

The hawk hopped around it, keeping it corralled in one place. 

“It *is* three mice. A little beat up, looks like they’ve been out in the wilds for some time. And their tails are… well… they seem to be…” Hye noticed that the three stood huddled together, back to back, their tails entwined. At the ends, though, they seemed almost fuzed, as if they had been knotted together ages ago and merged. “Tangled?”

Advika set down the pack and looked up.

“Their tails are connected, right? Each has some little injury, like a scarred eye or damaged ear?”

“Yes… yes how did you —“

“They’re a fusion,” said Advika, walking over and squatting low to better see. “They’re linked, or, more correctly, fuzed. Look.”

The tails of the three mice came together in not a knot, but a kind of junction, like the center of a starfish. It was a little uneven, as though the tails had grown together after each mouse had been alive some time. They weren’t born that way.

“They’re tame, *right?*” Advika had addressed this last question to the mice directly. One of the mice nodded, then the others, and all three then wiped their paws on their chests and held their paws out, palms up.

“Good.”

Hye leaned in close. “They’re hybrids too?”

The mouse closest, missing one eye, nodded. The mouse next to it had scars where its nostrils had been, but still both eyes which it used for staring eagerly at her. The closest mouse was sniffing. Hye held the back of her hand up to it for closer inspection. It held her finger in its little paws, which were gentle and dextrous, while its whiskers tickled as it took rapid, deep whiffs of her skin. The others were sniffing too, almost in tandem.

“Do you…” Hye started, then was lost in thought. There was a pattern to the injuries. At least one of the three had a perfect set of ears, eyes, or nostrils. The other two would be injured in some way, though not animal attack. They were surgical scars, deliberate damage. “You sense for each other? Do you share sensation?” The mouses seemed confused. “Ah, feel. You feel what the others feel? Shared feeling?”

They nodded vigorously.

“Fusions are quite rare,” said Advika, securing the last pack to the moto. She opened her jacket. Her cinder hawk, Bööm, who had landed moments earlier and was now with Juju eagerly watching Hye’s investigation of the fusion. Advika patted her chest again. Bööm bounced onto the back of the moto and into the opening with wing-assisted hops.

“I’m not sure what your name is,” said Hye, “so I'm going to call you Trine. How do you like that name for now?” 

The three turned to each other, as if to discuss, and then an instant later all three looked at Hye and half-nodding half-shrugging, seemed to say, *works for us*. Hye opened a a secondary pocket on the front of her qalip. Designed for quick access to small items like food that needed some insulation from the cold, it got some of the cinder hawk’s heat.

Trine looked at Advika and Bööm, then realized they would be sitting close to the hawk. The three mice shook their heads. One pointed to Juju, while the second pantomimed biting the third, its arms raised like evil wings.

“Juju will be good, right?” Asked Hye, tossing the hawk a scrap of dry fish.

The cinder hawk trotted over the ice to the mice and once again looking from Hye to the mice several times, then sighed a defeated raptor sigh. Taking its minor sadness as ascent, Hye tossed it another scrap of fish and patted her chest. Juju hopped in and Hye closed the flap.

“See? You’ll get along great. Come on, Trine, you’ll be safe here.

The little fusion of mice situated themselves into this pocket, all three heads able to poke out from the pocket flap at will and chirped merrily with warmth. Mutually curious, the hawk leaned over and let the nearest mouse touch her beak and sniff it as they set off down river.

A bellow came from the woods, starting low and finishing in a high pitched blare closer to siren than a natural sound. Cracks and shots of splintering trees echoed over the ice as whatever it was charged through the few trees between it and the frozen river edge.

Hye and her tutor stood, staring in the direction of the threat.

“What is it?” Hye asked.

“I’m not sure, but time for another lesson. Here.”Advika held out the guard’s pistol, heavy and so warm with body heat it almost steamed in the arctic air. 

The ogumo, the Viceroy, the explosion, flashed through Hye’s mind.

“Hyeon”

Hye took the pistol, held it pressed between her mittens.

“Like this,” the Sifu took the gun back to demonstrate. “Right hand mitten cover off, finger on trigger, left hand mitten covering. You try.”

Hye did and felt the weight of the gun. She looked down the sights as she had a thousand times. In drills, when practicing. Never at a charging, angry, monstrous threat. Shaggy dark brown fur, matted and tangled. It lumbered like a bear, but had huge visible horns.

“Ram… bear…some bison,” Hye analyzed aloud. Its hooves thundered on the ice and great hump shook. “Probably.”

Hye squeezed and shot. The bullet was wide and short, sending up a spray of snow where it impacted. The creature raced by, oblivious and enraged.

“Wait!” Said the Sifu in a whisper.

“Don’t shoot it?”

“Not yet, closer.”

The river was massive. The had camped at the thickest part of the bend. It would have run almost a kilometer by the time it got to them. Plenty of time to contemplate death.

“Why closer,” Hye asked, attempting to remain calm.

“Hand guns are only accurate at thirty meters for expert marks. For you, less. Ten meters.”

“I can’t, I can’t.” Hye realized she was crying, tears and snot freezing to her face.

Less than two hundred yards away, coming fast.

“You *will*.” Advika shifted her body slightly, everything lining up, as if she were aiming from her shoulders, pelvis, and heels. “Mirror me. Head on. Great burning demons here it comes.”

“It will be right on top of us. What if I miss!?”

“You won’t. This is your second time firing at something alive. You’ve yet to kill, though. You must learn to survive out here. You won’t miss. If you do, I’ll die.”

In an instant, the world became clearer, slower, and louder. Her fear hardened into diamond focus. The ice trembled as the thing barreled towards them. It screamed again. The great thing’s teeth were yellowed at the roots, some missing, others cracked. Its eyes were mismatched, one goatish, one bear. Jets of steam and snot poured from its nostrils. Each thundering hoof-fall sent a curling plume of ice crystals into the air around it, its withers shuddering, the patchy brown fur shaking as the thin muscles beneath rippled. 

Thin? It wasn’t angry, it was… hungry? Why scream?

“Here it comes.”

Why was it so loud? No predator would warn its prey. It should be an apex…

“No no no,” said Hye, “it’s running from something.”

An instant later, they saw what. 

Tigers. *Mostly *tigers. 

Two of them. One coming up each side of the river. Two more emerged from the edges of the far side of the bend, right behind the terrified beast. A pincer move. They’d camped in the wrong spot. Just plain bad luck.

“Shoot!”

The bang rippled across the ice. The tigers winced. A mist of blood rose up from the great hump on the bison-bear’s back. But it kept running.

“Again!”

Hye took another breath, steadied, and fired a third shot. It was short and low, throwing up a spray of ice well ahead of and wide of the beast.

Advika placed a hand on her student’s shoulders.

“Breathe, in”—Hye’s shoulders rose—“out”—they fell—“Shoot.”

Four more shots rang out. The creature roared in pain and stumbled, rolling over itself on the ice. Now the tigers were in motion, turning, claws carving ice. Full sprint, an opportunity not to be missed. The two that had been roughly behind Advika and Hye ran past. As they did, Hye noticed the huge pointy ears and oddly shaped noses. Sharp chirps and whistles accompanied them.

“Bats?” 

Advika said, “It would appear so.”

The wounded beast was rising again, roars of agony and terror splitting the tundra. The first tiger reached it and skidded just short. Others arrived and they circled, each looking to the others. Coordinating, signaling, their chirps and clicks bouncing off the ice, just audible between their quarry’s dying bellows.

Advika reached a hand out, her eyes never leaving the tigers, and pressed down on the gun, lowering it. The first tiger leaped. The fallen bison bear rose up and swiped with a massive hoof, knocking it through the air. The tiger-bat slammed onto the ice and spun, dazed.

“None of these things know what they’re doing,” Advika said. “They’ve got competing instincts. Tigers and bats are solitary hunters, but bats communal. Bison are prey, bears are predator. It’s all mixed up. Genes need time to work together, to understand one another. The underlying drives are too complex.”

Hye and Advika watched the battle rage until one tiger managed to leap up behind the bison-bear. Webbing from its elbows to sides stretched and was backlit furious orange and red. Its claws dug deep and its fangs sank into the neck of the terrified monstrosity. A gout of blood sprayed. The beast reeled, a geyser of gore from its nose and mouth. The two more joined, tearing and slashing.  The beast fell. A final gurgled moan, then it was still.

The stunned tiger stood, shook itself, and padded to the fresh kill.

As it did, the last two tigers to attack stepped back and turned to face Advika and Hye. They sat, flaking the fallen beast, as their packmates started eating.

“They’re guarding it,” said Hye.

She felt a tugging on her collar. Looking down, she saw the blind mouse of the fusion looking up, squeaking, tugging at the flap that held them in place. Juju, confused, looked everywhere, unsure of where to focus—the tigers, Hye, or the mice. Hye released the flap and Trine emerged.

Through pantomime, Trine made a request that took Hye a few guesses, but got vigorous nods when she said, “You want Juju to carry you to the bat-tigers?”

“We should probably have Bööm do it, I can give her the commands.”

Trine shrugged acceptance. No preference.

Advika said a few words, Bööm hopped out and gently grasped Trine in her talons. A few wing beats and they were airborne, the cinder hawk staying low as not to surprise the tigers. They shuffled as she approached, clicking and chirping, tilting their heads. The pack leaders sat up. Bööm landed, leaving some distance. Trine crossed the empty space on their own. All four tigers, bloodied and hulking, stared at the tiny triumvirate which now chirped at them. One tiger came close and put its face level to the ice. Trine walked up and laid all six paws on it. They then scampered back to Bööm, who lifted the mice and flew back. The guard tigers turned away, joining their pack mates in the feast, no longer interested in the humans.

“Well done, little friends,” said Advika as Hye tucked them back into her pocket.

Staying slow, Advika drove the snow moto along side the pack, then stopped. All four lifted their bloodied heads, hot with bison innards, steam rising into the sky. Hye could not understand it at the time, but would later ask and learn Advika had said, *Thank you, new beasts, for passage. Enemies follow. Fast, reckless, and do not care for the old things. We will leave The Tower and those within to their own ways, we only pass through. These others do not know such respect.*

There was no acknowledgement. Each lowered its head to return to eating.

Advika and Hye drove on towards the glint to the north, dusk approaching.

The clear sky held for an hour before the southern horizon darkened. A fast moving storm, flickering with lightning, chased them north. The hasty sub-arctic dusk combined with the heavy clouds and swirling snow to create midnight darkness by mid-afternoon. Winds whipped up ice crystals and old snow that stung their faces. Useless, the cinder hawks hunkered their pouches. Sideways driven snow obscured the world; each infuriating snow flake mirrored back their headlights into a churning white wall. They slowed to a half-speed crawl. To come this far to smash into a tree or drive off an unseen ledge was not an option. Advika piloted by memory and will. 

After grueling hours, Hye saw lights beyond their own moto lamps. Dim and yellowed, they stretched along the ground and, far above, a line, almost floating. As they approached, more seemed to appear and the shape of the facility came into view. It was a compound, perhaps a half dozen buildings. Advika turned the moto between two, the snow swirling and eddying up, the wind trapped and confused in the narrow passage. Implied through the snow were large majestic curves of stone or concrete with fortress-like squatness. The Tower itself was the antithesis of squat: a shadow of thin, twisting stone that widened as it rose, dotted with light here and there. The top, though obscured, seemed to be capped with a great uneven disc or dome. An arc of light blazed out from it, a galaxy of snow spiraling through the glow. 

As they approached the tower base, a door opened, a rectangle of light flickering with the visual static of blown snow. A person, or so it seemed, stood at the door, gesturing them in, silhouetted against the warm interior lights.

“You made it!” The voice was delighted. “We, I, have been expecting you!”

Trine writhed inside Hye’s jacket pocket. Advika slowed the moto to a stop, still several meters from the door.

“Trine doesn’t like this,” Hye said,” they’re upset.”

“Not a surprise. Pretty sure they escaped from here.”

“What do we do?”

“We have little other option,” said Advika. She turned the throttle and let the moto creep forward. The beam of the headlight swept across the person framed in the door, illuminating her face and clothing. Like a statue, she held up a hand in greeting, a warm smile on her face, simple monks robes draped from her shoulders down to her feet.

Again she waved them in, gesturing at a small opening, a little garage. Advika drove the moto in. The wind quieted as the door behind them began to lower. Gentle lights illuminated around them as they were dismounting. An interior door opened.

“Greetings,”said their strange host, “I am the Uyasami. We are pleased you have arrived. Follow me, you must be exhausted.”

She stepped back, then walked away into the facility, leaving the door open behind her.

Hye and Advika, weary and wary but happy to be warm, began to unstrap the small packs that held their essentials.

Hye paused. She looked up at the Sifu.

“We?”
