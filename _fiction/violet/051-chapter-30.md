Their pace across the ice was hard and monotonous. There had been little to see. The Wilds, populated as they were, could still be empty for vast stretches. No matter the adaptations of the animals and hybrids, Siberian tundra in winter was a harsh, brutal place.

Perhaps three hours out, Advika slowed to a stop in the middle of the river while there was still some reserve charge. Bööm wriggled to be let out, as did Juju. Hye reached for her clasp but Advika stilled her hand. The Sifu pulled out a pair of binoculars and handed them to Hye. She gestured to a huge dark spot far off on the side of a low hill, perhaps a kilometer or two away. Amorphous, the spot shifted and moved, its edges blurry. Through the binoculars, Hye saw a huge herd of caribou. Among them were massive elk, doubling the height of their neighbors. Each loomed like a gargantuan sentinel, their erect heads well above the tops of the caribou antlers. Despite their hugeness, the antlers of the elks themselves seemed impossibly large. Starting from thick stalks, they spread into huge, moose-like paddles then ended in at least twenty of the classic grey-to-white points.

“Baikal Wapiti,” said Advika, “resurrected from the old extinct cervine stock. Colossal deer, taller at the shoulder than even Yukon moose by at least a foot. Thicker skeletons. Denser musculature. Far larger and stronger antlers.”

The titans roamed among their modern peers, watchful, knowing. Blasts of steam came from their nostrils. Hye caught a new movement, low, among and through the legs of the herd. One entered a small clearing: wolves, Siberian grays. Far to the edges of the herd, though, a second set of titans. Stoic, scanning the horizon, were wolves that were nearly the size of the elk themselves.

“There are dire wolves in there,” Hye said, not letting the binoculars waver. “Why aren’t they attacking? Why aren’t the elk… is that *whole thing* a swarm?”

“Yes. A herdpack,” said the Sifu. “A single ecosystem, hybridized and symbiotic. The wolves protect *and* eat the wapiti. They are shepherd and wolf.  The Baikal Wapiti and Dire — both extinct Ice Age species — are near human intelligence. Think of the dumbest of Jee’s sergeants. These are just a hair smarter. The scorwev swarm at the Olgoi was pure instinct; a herdpack scouts, plans, maneuvers. Look.”

The Sifu pointed at the forest edge. After a moment, Hye saw them, little flickers within the deep tree shadow.

“The herdpack is, like most swarms, able to operate on a kind of collective intelligence. Body language, scent, sounds, along with what are, in effect, lateral line whiskers that sense changes in air pressure, proximity, and temperature — it’s hard to say where the individuals end and group begins. Unlike most swarms, herdpacks have leaders, amplifying and guiding that group mind. Their scouts”—she nodded towards the woods—“operate in pairs or triples. What you saw in the woods are one set running to tell another before returning. Sometimes they’ll have dedicated runners.”

“We can’t camp here, can we?”

“No,” said the Sifu. “Had we stopped ten minutes ago, we’d have been fine, out of range and unseen. Now, we’ll need to put as much distance as possible. Hold on.”

Advika revved the throttle and they shot off down the river.

As they rounded the bend, Hye turned to look back. There, standing on the edges of both sides of the river, were several sets of wolves watching them depart. In the center of the ice, where their moto had been, was a single massive wolf, a dire, with a scar across one eye. Its lone eye held her gaze, evaluating, until they disappeared behind the trees.
