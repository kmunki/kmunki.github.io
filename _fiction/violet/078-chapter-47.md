Moonlight sifted through clouds and gauzy curtains into the darkened room. Scattered and ghostly, it danced across the ceiling and walls. Objects so lit were impressionistic, each a silver-edged shadow. Illapa’s eyes traced the thin, elegant line of Msizi’s neck and shoulder, down the camisoled curve of her side to the rise of her hips. She radiated a sleeper’s heat. Illapa bathed in it. Who had seduced whom, she wondered. The Onzulu Ambassador’s wry wink, behind the mirror flash of those octagonal glasses; the toss of her long plaited hair; her mental fencing, landing strikes of cutting wit upon others while saving those barbed with teasingly lust for only her. Illapa longed for the clouds to pass, to allow enough moon glow to admire Msizi’s smooth dark skin. As if to tease her, a shadow passed over the moon, leaving the room darker still. Scent and touch would have to sate for now.

The temptation to rouse this woman for another round was tempered, though. The mission was already off course. Six days of ceremonies, of mingling, of strategizing and planning, already thwarted by the Ward. How had the Olokun not known? A conversation with the whale, uplift or no, was overdue if she could not deliver—but to the mission. Plans, as the cliche went, rarely survived contact not just with the enemy, she realized, but with reality. We synthesize and distill our world, abstracting it, leaving it like the room now, the thinnest of outlines, ignorance lit by a single, reedy source. Reality is an imagined thing, an illusion of comfort, like that of control, or destiny. But that is why she became an agent. The mission is to bend reality to one’s desire. Success is not destined, nor the situation in control, nor comfort guaranteed. Through chaos and pain, her will, her skill, she could manifest change. That was the very title—Agent—wasn’t it?

A sound from the darkness. One that would wake no sleeper. Had her breath fallen at a different cadence, she may have missed it. Behind the door, was a presence. Some terrified animal part of her sensed it—a gift from whatever ancient ancestor had lived because she too had been unable to sleep, kept awake by some innate awareness of a hungry gaze from just outside the cave. Illapa’s senses tunneled, every rod and cone, every cochlear hair, straining for signal through black silence. For a heartbeat, a flicker of shame at her fear, likely of nothing, mere hypnagogic pareidolia. Like a cullable child, afraid of shapes in the shadows.

Yet the air held a hint of tang, subtle and wrong. Her repose shifted to a hunker, pantherish and tense. On silent hinges the shadowed outline of the door edged open. A crack, enough to peer through. A waft of rot stung her eyes and sinuses. Illapa fought the urge to hold her breath, her own silence a possible tell. Satisfied that it remained undetected, the thing on the doorstep laid its fingertips against the door. It swung open, soundless and slow. Framed in a square of midnight hallway gloom, a bent silhouette. Heavy, panting breaths came from the thing—wet, rapid, and animal. 

There was a loud clack as something hard hit the wood floor and bounced to a stop, like a single die dropped and rolled. Illapa gripped the sheet in her fist. The thing froze, its breath seizing. Msizi mumbled the mumble of one who has half woken. 

It took half a step forward.

Illapa flicked the light switch. A naked man recoiled, pulling a wounded and bloodied arm over his eyes and barking a ragged shout of surprise. Its mouth—bloodied teeth, clenched in a ravenous, tortured rictus, were grimly framed by a tattered border of lipless flesh. A crimson bib ran from jaw to sternum. The arm dropped, exposing rolling, lidless eyes, bloodshot and dilated. Mutilated gashes seeped with gore where once had been a nose, ears, genitals, and fingernails. Lesions, sores, and contusions littered the rest of his ruined body. He—it—glared for an instant at the betraying black-red tooth on the ground.

“What in—” Msizi began.

It lunged. Illapa was already midair, hurdling Msizi, sheet bunched in each fist. She crashed into it, sheet taught, the edge catching it under the neck, her knees driving into its pelvis. As a tangle they slammed into the floor. With wrapped hands she grabbed its head and hammered it over and over into the floor. It spasmed and thrashed with each meaty impact.

“Get out! Run!” Illapa yelled at Msizi. “Wake the others! Get out of the building!”

Msizi, who had been screaming, continued to do so as she ran into the hall. Fueled by rage and ignorant of pain, the thing bucked, throwing Illapa to the side, furious at its prey’s escape. It writhed, desperate to untangle itself from the grume-stained sheet. It stood, wheeling on Illapa who, sheet-less herself, was naked and exposed. With a hoarse howl it lunged and slashed at her. The technique was familiar—every bar brawl looked the same—red-eyed rage mixed with motor impairment. For seconds, Illapa thought it would be an easy victory, dodging each sloppy swipe and incompetent kick. Broken as this man has been he was still a man, now wounded. One well aimed punch would do it—she swung, and as she did, it turned into the strike, opening its mouth wide. Her fist shattered the half-rotten maw, fragments of dentine and enamel spraying in every direction. The jagged remnants embedded in her knuckles. Then it bit down.

Illapa screamed in pain and horror. It grabbed at her neck, gore slick hands scrabbling for a killing grip. She slammed her free hand into its face, locking out her elbow, and then pressed a bare foot against its chest and kicked. Her fist tore free and the thing reeled backwards onto the bed. Illapa grabbed the edge of the mattress and flipped it against the wall, pinning it there. As she did, Msizi reappeared in the hall. At the sight of her gore-flecked lover braced against a mattress behind which thrashed a thing more animal than man, she froze.

“I said run!” Said Illapa, straining to keep the thing from freeing itself.

“We are locked in. Every entrance is barred. No one replied at my banging.”

“Everyone is dead! Dead! Dead!” Eshma’s ornateness appeared alongside Msizi, her sleeping gown perhaps even more glamorous than what she had worn the prior evening. The thing shrieked, attempting to lever off the increasingly bloodied bed frame and wall. “What is *that!*” Screamed Eshma, her own shriek drowning out that of its cause.

“I can’t—” Illapa was interrupted as the thing launched itself off the wall, nearly bending the mattress flat.

Msizi’s eyes widened. “Hold on! I have an idea. Hold on as long as you can then run for the kitchen.”

“The kitchen?” Eshma and Illapa said in tandem.

“Eshma, come on.” Msizi grabbed the fellow ambassador ran off.

A hand reached around the mattress edge and gripped, folding it back. Her containment strategy failing, Illapa looked around, desperate. Nothing was a make-do weapon, no heavy lamp base, no broken table leg. She needed to give herself a chance to run—the door. If she could get to the door, close it behind her… it would have to do. She crouched, suddenly freeing the thing from the wall. She felt it turn just enough, ready to crawl over the mattress, and she slammed it back into the wall and ran. It croaked with stunned fury, but she was already across the room, pulling the door shut behind her. The door crashed closed, she spun around, gripping the handle with both hands, her ruined knuckles each a blade of pain, and braced her feet on the door frame. Half an instant later it yanked on the handle. The door opened a few inches before Illapa could rear back. It shoved a hand through the gap, its fingers rupturing between the door and frame. It thrashed and yanked, desperate to free it self and get vengeance on its maimer. Illapa began a count down in her head. Ten more seconds. I can do this for nine more seconds. You’ve dealt with more pain than this for eight seconds. Each sentence passed a second, carrying her will to the next. Msizi and Eshma needed every moment. Two more seconds and it’s over, she told herself. Here we go—in one.

The thing yanked, and she released the handle, letting the momentum carry her upright, as she brought her feet beneath her. Resistance gone, the door flung open and the thing hurled itself backwards into the room, tripping over the tangled sheet and crashing into the closet. Or so Illapa imagined, she was already skidding around the corner and hurling herself down the stairs. She leaped down the final five, landing and rolling in the main reception hall. Only hours prior, how lovely this had all seemed, she thought. She left bloody footprints across the Great Seal of the New Joseon in a dead sprint for the kitchen. 

“No!” The thing yelled. It was not a roar or a scream, but a hoarse, garbled yell of a *word*. She could hear… not it—him—there was a *mind* in there still, scrambling and stumbling across the upper hallway. 

There, in the kitchen, as promised, was Msizi, standing in another doorway. A way out? Illapa sprinted towards them, vaulted the stainless steel counter and rolled beneath Msizi’s arm gripping the handle. Behind her, the door did not slam shut, as she had expected, but was pulled closed, then with a final forceful tug, sealed and latched. Msizi wedged a can of beans between the lever handle on the door, then pushed Illapa and Eshma towards the back of the room.

No, not a room.

“The walk-in?” Illapa hissed.

Msizi, eyes wide, put a finger to her lips. The fridge had an L-shape. Just as they rounded the back corner, a crazed face darkened the small square window in the door. Huffs of breath fogged the plexiglass. A scraping, bone on metal, came from the door.

“The handle,” Msizi explained in a desperate whisper, lips touching Illapa’s ear, “is one piece. A simple combined lever. To enter the fridge, you pull, to exit, you push.”

The beans were a makeshift lock. To open the door, the can would need to be crushed. There, on the floor, were sheets and glittering clothes, gathered from Eshma’s room, of course. Illapa breathed a sigh of relief—she had seduced a woman who knew how to survive. 

For a desperate minute, it investigated, attempting the handle and pressing its sweat greased forehead against the window. A cry, muffled through the door and by distance, came from elsewhere in the residence. It whipped away and stormed off.

They sat in silence, huddled amid the sheets and vegetables.

“Your hand,” said Msizi.

The wounds were red, angry, and the flesh to the wrist had puffed. Illapa pressed her lips into a line, and closed her eyes. She attempted to flex her fingers, clenching her teeth through the pain. A wave of dizziness ran through her, then nausea. *Oh no*, she realized, letting herself kneel into the sheets.
