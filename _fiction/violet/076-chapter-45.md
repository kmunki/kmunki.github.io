Parties were like flower gardens, Saongwon Moon thought as he retreated up the stairs to his bedchamber. One of dozens of bits of wisdom bestowed upon him by his mentor. She always had a little aphorism to distill some nuanced learning into a crystalline mnemonic. In a flower garden, the aim is not perfect harvestable crops, all in neat rows, easy to fertilize and weed. One wanted the colors to mix and cluster, for the flowers to spill over their boxes and to layer upon one another. And while you prepared the soil and planted the seeds, each must grow on its own. As the general din of the gathering rose to a crescendo of laughter before another subsiding, he paused, resting his finger tips on the banister, as though perching, smiled to himself. 

The re-arrangement had worked magnificently. A space designed for triple the number they had here, he had made to feel intimate. Adjusting draperies and room dividers, clustering the seating off to one side, leaving the vast space beneath the chandelier empty had wedged the guests together, driving conversation and connection. Better still, it gave breathing space to the pavilion’s many treasures. Turning half the room into a gallery of sorts, the old screens that traditionally hung from the ceiling lowered for intimate perusal. Opening space beneath the chandelier liberated the vast carpet featuring an ornamental and interpretive rendition of the Joseon seal, one of the many gifts received on the Continuum’s fiftieth anniversary. Somewhat garish to most Koryo tastes, it was ostentatious enough to please those who preferred more a more baroque aesthetic, such as the Vizier. More important, however, was that it awed guests, who walked around it rather than across. Another peal of laughter rippled through the crowd, warming him with satisfaction.

Pleased, Saongwon Moon pushed off the balcony and made his way to his room. To anyone else, it was indistinguishable from a guest room. This was by design. At the center of the room, feet to the door, was the bed, low and simple, a firm mattress on a bamboo frame with a tufted headboard. On one side was a wardrobe and dresser. On the other, a small sitting area with a kettle and hi-fi turntable on a credenza, within which was a cupboard for tea service and a cubby for a dozen vinyl albums, curated by room. He had been particularly pleased earlier when the scent of Assam and the dulcet notes of a raga wafted from the room of the Rajput Ambassador.

He turned at the faint sound of his door opening. Expecting to see one of the staff, he nearly began chastising them before realizing it was a woman he had never seen before.

“Oh, I’m sorry—” he began to say, as if apologizing for his assumption. Guests became lost all the time. She would not have been the first to mistake his room for their own.

Pressing the door shut behind her, she leaned against it, her hands behind her. Who was she? The guest list was small, hardly a dozen ambassadors, plus aides for those who traveled with them. Yet he could not place her. Panic rose in his chest. She wore black, a looser fitting black silk suit in the Continuum style. Her skin was pale, stark contrast with her outfit, hair, and her all-black eyes.

“I’m sorry, honored guest, it appears you’ve entered the wrong room. And I’m embarrassed to admit that I cannot—”

“I’m not in the wrong room. You are the Saongwon for this residence, are you not, Saongwon Moon? You’re just the man I want to see.”

Her voice was restrained, as though she were holding back some appetite. One arm was white, not merely pale, but synthetic, hard, and glossy. In it she held—

She cupped his chin and drew his eyes to hers.

“Saongwon, I need you to focus, on me. I have questions. You’ll answer them directly. Are we clear?”

An overwhelming urge to assent washed over the Saongwon. What would the harm be in answering her questions. She seemed trustworthy enough. He felt safe with her.

“No, honored guest, I cannot.” He strained with propriety. “I believe you’re in my room mistakenly. Let me help you find your intended destination.”

She scrutinized his face and throat, and, seeming satisfied, held up a small wooden block tied to her belt. It was a carving of two dragons entwined in battle, the artistry such that the rectangular shape was preserved despite the serpentine writhing of the subjects.

“The Viceroy’s talisman,” he stammered.

“Ah good so you know it. I’m here on his behalf. Now, “ she leaned in closer, “my questions.”

Saongwon Moon was heady with desire. Not with lust, though he could not deny his attraction. A kind of reverence, an intense need to serve and obey. The feeling waves over him in waves Another part within himself was shouting, fighting, and resisting. Who *was *this woman? Anyone could have that talisman. He’d never seen her in his life. The building was closed to visitors for precisely this reason. What if she were working for the Ward, or—

“The Sifu,” she asked, “is she here? Where?”

“Her room is on the far side of the upper level. The—” what was he doing? Why was he telling her. The waves of reverence crashed over him now, like surf tossing the lone swimmer of sanity in his mind against the rocks.

“Focus, Saongwon, focus. Where?”

He pointed, “The far corner room.”

*No! *He mentally berated himself, but the voice was lost, swirling and helpless, able only to watch.

“Good. And the rest?”

“Ambassadors, their aides, their staff.”

“No one else?”

“None.”

“Weapons?”

“Few came armed. The rest, confiscated.”

“You have your badge?”

He held it up.

“This lets you into any room, correct?” She asked as she took it.

“Yes. Not even guards have that access. Only the head of security and the residence’s Saongwon.”

“And me.” She held up the talisman, then pulled him close, her black eyes swirling infinite voids. “Put the Residence in isolation. There is a credible threat. The guards are to report their findings to the Viceroy’s personal attachment. All other security is not cleared for updates and should treat the residence with caution. Discussion of the matter to those not cleared is punishable as the Viceroy sees fit.”

The Saongwon floated behind himself now, a ghost, as his body walked to the credenza and, tilting back one of the hi-fi speakers, pressed a small red button. A click, followed by a low hum, came from the speaker. Helpless, he repeated the instructions, gave his clearance and authorization, received confirmation of orders received, and clicked the speaker off again. Throughout the building, there was a subtle sounds of sliding steel, shifting latches, and lowering of window bars.

“You will leave the Sifu’s body intact.” The instruction jabbed into his mind like a splinter. She took his hand, wrapping the badge strap around his wrist. “And give her my regards, won’t you?”

There was a flash of yellow, then pain exploded from the side of his neck. Burning, like molten acid in his veins, seared up into his skull and down his chest, back, and arm. For an instant, he clawed at himself, desperate to dig whatever it was lodged in him out. His legs gave way, knees slamming into the floor. Doubling over, he retched. He was salivating, tears ran freely from his eyes and out his nose. To his horror, he felt his bowels empty as he retched again.

Looking up, he saw the woman reach for him again, withdrawing whatever it was from his neck. A hollow vial. She smiled at him, as though he were a child taking his first steps, as she slid out the door. The edges of his vision purpled. His teeth and eyes hurt. His fingernails and toenails burned. Every sense screamed as though pricked with electric needles—ears popping, tongue sizzling, sinuses caustic. But from beneath it all came a need. A powerful, relentless, all-consuming need. The last thought the man who was Saongwon Moon blacked out was not a thought at all, but an urge most primal.

Hunger. 

Overwhelming, unstoppable, insatiable hunger.
