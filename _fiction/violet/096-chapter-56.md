Hye touched a finger to the agar film glossing the triple slash across her face. Gold-leaf thin, the peach-colored membrane of molecules turned long gouges to neat, near-healed slices. What scars there were would be faint as memories rather than ragged white monuments. 

On the blinking security console, the grayscale screens turning the lurid carnage into the face of the moon, Trine sniffed and reached for her. Their heads stretched seeking affection. She obliged them touch, the only sense all three shared equally, running her fingers from the bridges of their noses, between their eyes and ears, to the back of their heads. With each stroke, her fingertips passed between only one intact sense per mouse, the other two half and fully maimed — blinded, deafened, or dulled. And yet, they were fused, that knot of a tail blessed them when dipped in the sacrament of agar. So now each commanded more than any one alone: three ears, three eyes, three nostrils; six sensitive paws, and three hybrid minds. Never alone.

The Sifu moved meditative through her preparative kata. Each magazine was loaded, ejected, pouched, removed from the black arachnoweave vest; pistols holstered and drawn. The shotgun was slung across her back; across her front, the bandolier rippled red with cartridges. Dangling beneath, two odd objects, kerosene lanterns turned more catastrophic Molotov cocktails, thin glass globes thick with viscous white. Thus armed she bent and flexed, knelt and twisted, testing the balance and give. Weeks ago, her leg had been shredded meat and exposed bone. Within the chryscast, a thimble of agar needed only days to again make meat muscle, weave tendon, reknit the skin. Had they found Winji hours, perhaps just minutes sooner, her rent neck would have healed just the same.

Agar, the miracle, precipitated from the Dust of the Gods, was savior and nemesis. The Sifu was injured outrunning a scorwev swarm, individual and collective impossible without agar’s aid. She, an asura, baptized and reborn in red-orange, her irises mutating to luminous purple. Hye’s soon-to-be-scars, formed by the ruined hand of a ruined man, now agar-made monster. She, Hye, herself, once a Lucky embryo among billions, nurtured and gestated from her first cell’s first spark in the divine ichor. What luck? To be the cruel center of a shadow war? Agar gave her life, yes, and haunted it with horrors. The looming jet-black ogumo, the thundering, ravenous hybrids of the Wilds, the mad and maniacal Zaqqum, and now, the brutal busaw.

There, on the monitors, in bleak black and white, it stalked the kitchen. In a mere four days, Moon, a man of slight build and servile nature, had become a hulking threat. Muscle, heaped on a mutant skeleton, rippled beneath the hellish topography of warped osseous plates over teratoma blistered skin. Not mere scabs and pustules, but tumorous clumps of half-formed teeth, eyes, fingernails, and knots of hair pocked the creature. Shards of bone erupted through the pallid skin, like buds of lost, demonic antlers. Where wounded, the monstrous metabolism had rebuilt incoherently, substituting a mis-formed fist for missing foot. In the empty shattered orbit where once had been an eye now flexed four knuckled fingers, each tipped with a rheumy dot, like segmented and stiff snail eye-stalks. Broken teeth and sharp tusks jutted from its ever-open jaw. A living inversion of health, cancer’s cadaverous avatar, the busaw maliced their accidental allies. 

Gun fire and angry bellows told Hye and Advika the plan had already been altered within minutes of leaving the armory. A student of action films, a veritable wuxia addict, Hye found watching Illapa strafe and dodge past the busaw, barely diving back into the fridge, the door now dented and rent, a surreal experience. No pulsing score or stylish maneuvers, just unrehearsed desperation and malevolence, one directed by decades of training, the other by millennia of unleashed evolution. The poor camera made each shot sound tinny and weak, the image grainy and bland. Yet her heart beat terror’s tattoo against her ribs for a single reason: this was real. 

As the Sifu readied herself, Hye’s tasks had been simple: Load her gun, study the escape route, and tell her Sifu when the situation was terminal.

“It ripped a pipe from the wall. I think it’s,” Hye leaned forward, straining, “yes, it’s using it as a crowbar. They have minutes. Less.”

Advika chambered a round, walked to the door, and said, “Safe door. Outer doors. Alarm. Go.”

Hye executed, pressing the first button and the safe room door hissed open. The Sifu was already in the main hall. Hye flipped up two safety catches then, with each thumb, unlocked the outer doors and triggered the primary alarm. Deep mechanical grinding and thuds swept through the Residence as hidden heavy bolts and bars slid out of the exit doors. A klaxon wail grew outside, muffled but undeniable. Outside, red lights would now flash on the eve corners and ridges of the roof. The building, to the hundreds of enthronement guests, was like an angry, bawling infant, red and howling. No longer sole survivors, rescue could not be twisted into capture—the deaths and their war-relic cause would not be laid at the feet of the old asura or young Ward—so long as the witnesses survived. Illapa, an obvious agent, was a welcome ally but would hardly sway the council. No, only the true ambassadors would do. Eshma and Msizi’s lives were now tied to their own. 

 She heard metal rend, then a single gun shot. Hye rushed out into the hall, following the Sifu. A small river, water from the burst pipe, ran from the kitchen entrance into the main hall, soaking the carpet and shimmering across the surrounding hardwood. Hye, still limping, slid along the side wall, pressed against it, and crouched out of sight.

“If you are hungry, wretch, I am here,” said Advika. Chunks of gore, carried by the carrion tainted current, bounced off her feet and drifted downstream.

What had once been a man, now a violation, looked up at her. A single great red eye, blood and pupil, fixed her, while the awful stalks swayed and surveyed, unable to look up from the bent metal frame that would soon no longer keep them from their quarry. It was nature made unnatural, the governing principles removed not to allow life, but to obliterate it. It hulked. Muscle piled in shapes horrific and abnormal, all of it a fearful asymmetry.

“Yes you.”

She squeezed the trigger again. The shot was startling against the relative quiet of trickling of polluted water and muted alarm. The bullet glanced off the dome of its head, creating first a spurt of black blood then an oozing line down its skullish face. With its smaller, more dextrous, less deformed arm, the busaw pulled the pipe free. Another shot thudded into its abdomen. The bullet never exited, as though she had shot a corpse in a grave. It tilted for ward and in one, two steps was in a lunging sprint, bent pipe held high. Advika was a statue unleashing hell, flickering in the muzzle’s fire light. In the few seconds the creature took to close the gap, the old asura had emptied the clip into its chest and face. She dropped her stabilizing had to her hip. It leaped, she shifted her weight, stepping aside as it barreled past, swinging and slashing. With a balletic sweep of her hand, the kerosene grenade was loosed, lighter flicked, and hurled onto its disfigured back. The pus-white styrene-kerosene napalm coated it, blending in among the oozing wouds for the milliseconds before it turned to red flame and black smoke.

“Hye! Now!” The Sifu yelled over the thing’s enraged moans and screams.

Hye sloshed through the kitchen to the fridge door.

“The doors are unlocked, we have to get out!”

“Working on it!” Illapa shouted from within, her voice just rising above the din of hurled metal. In the handful of seconds between the interrupting shot and the current moment, Illapa had caught up to the new plan—distract, escape. Hope overrode terror. She, Msizi, even Eshma, pulled the shelving away with desperation. The mangled can of beans was wrenched free.

“Step back!” Illapa yelled as she pummeled the lever with her boot heel. On the fourth kick it gave and she stumbled through onto her hands and knees. Offal and grease skinned the swirling inches deep lake. Flickering fire light, whipping in angry red tongues, coated the creature. It thrashed and rolled, shattering the dainty tables and chairs where they had so ignorantly dallied days prior. Hye offered a hand, dragging Illapa to standing.

“It will kill her,” said Illapa.

“Only if we give it time to. We must go now. Follow me.”

Illapa acknowledged sharp and martial . Msizi, eyes wide, shaking, stammered and mumbled enough of a nod and agreement. Eshma, though, could not tear her mind from the grim vision beyond the kitchen. Amid the welter of wood splinters and floating gore it splashed, but water would not help it; the fire clung like fulgent lichen.

“The Sifu…”

The old asura had holstered her pistols and, lit red by the flames, lifted her shotgun to her shoulder. *Boom*. Where the pistol shots were child’s claps compared to the twelve-gauge’s thundercrack. Where the bullets had been like pebbles tossed against a rhino’s hide, the slug punched through bone plate and burning flesh like an awl through a rotten egg. On its transit the solid metal blossomed into a shredding star, spiraling and tumbling before exiting by creating a crater of a wound. Whirling chunks of meat and droplets of flames spattered in buoyant blobs that skittered across the surface, bobbing and burning.

Illapa took the ambassador by the shoulders, “we will die here if we do not move!” She whipped the Rajput woman around and shoved her into the main hall. Eshma staggered forward, found her footing, took one look and screamed. Blinded by flame, deafened by the sound of its own crackling and boiling flesh, the piercing sound became the center of the busaw’s world. As it turned, the Sifu sent another slug through its shoulder, hewing a half-circle, as if the beast had taken a bite of itself. Hye hobble-ran to Eshma, pulling the terror-struck woman towards the water just as the great malformed arm of the busaw, trailing streamers of dying fire, raked through the air. It smashed into Hye, hooking the cloth of her jacket and meat of her back, the force lifting and flinging her and Eshma together across the room.

“No!” Advika roared. Illapa and Msizi heard the booms and watched two great bursts of carnage erupt from the busaw’s chest. At this, even the pain numbed monstrosity was staggered.

“Get *her *out,” Advika’s words lanced at Illapa, hand pointed at Msizi, and eye’s locked on Hye. The old asura lifted her student from the water.

“I’m OK, I’m OK,” she spluttered and coughed.

“Go, the doors are open,” said Advika, “please. I’ll be right be—”

A horrific claw closed over the entirety of her head. Hye, aghast, watched stunned as the busaw lifted the twisting, fighting Sifu by her head and neck. A single jerk of its arm is all it would take. Blind rage drove it now, more than hunger or pain. She would suffer. It drew her close. Its great maw, ragged and bleeding, opened wide, exposing a barbed radula where a tongue should be. For an instant, it held her, face to face, blasting her with ghoulish breath, acidic and rotten. When they were nearly nose to not-nose, the old asura shoved the shotgun between them, the barrel slamming into its palette, and pulled the trigger. At the angle, the shotgun kicked hard and leaped free, landing in the water. But the slug had found its target, punching up through the front the busaw’s burning head and blood-boiled-brain to the air, the front of its face split like a melon. It stood, stunned, not releasing the Sifu. She felt its grip tightening. Her fingers found the second kerosine lantern and, after an instant of fumbling, the pressure in her skull growing to a fury, she felt it light and shoved it into the open chasm of the beast’s skull. A spasm rocked the creature as flames erupted within the cavity where Moon’s mind had once made home. Both arms jerked upwards hurling the Sifu up, spiraling through the air. She felt her vertebrae pop and her body slacken. Below the thing, more now an ogreish corpse piloted by a dying, rabid spine, seized and flailed.

At the height of her arc, her body twisted in the air, the movement pure momentum, for an instant weightless. Light spilled in. The doors were open. Four, then three, then two, the long shadows cast as they exited. Flickers of pistol muzzle flash, mere flint strikes, were a useless effort. Advika fell, then was caught by the chandelier, the beautiful crystals impaling her with a cacophonous tinkling. The suspension cable holding it lurched, the impact and imbalance of her weight more than any architect had ever anticipated. Around it, coiled as a snake, the electrical wire, powering the lights that still flickered within her flesh.

Somewhere, far off, she heard Hye’s shouts. Screams. For her, she thought. I have done all I can. I am old, Hye, and you are young. How could she explain. There had been time, but not the words. Now the words came, but not the time. My past lies heavy in me, and death hastens. My survival only burdens you now. Should we both walk out, allies or no, I will be revealed. Revealed and reviled as a relict and revenant; a plague, haunting this earth; a vivid dark memory, unforgettable. I have kept my promise. You survived. Now, you must thrive.

Below, the busaw writhed and thrashed. Her arms could move, her fingers grip. One moved to the power wire, the other her pistol. She aimed, then gripped. Even shielded, the hum of electricity danced into her fingers and bones. Three shots did double duty, dislodging the suspension cable mount and attracting the busaw’s remaining ire. The mount gave way and she, with the chandelier, fell. The power cable ripped and, though she held it still, now raw lightening coursed through her. Her hand exploded, leaving only a spear of bone. The power cable whipped free, a sparking snake striking and lashing with blue-white venom. Beneath her, crushed but not caged under the metal and glass, the busaw lurched. It would throw her and the chandelier off, then chase after. An army could not stop it and Ji-woo’s army would not. All options exhausted. 

*Hye will survive.*

Like a heaven sent spear, the old asura drove the bone of her arm into the neck of the beast and with her last stretch, grabbed the live wire, willing her muscles to contract together, driving the frayed end of the cable into the split open skull. Spider legs of searing blue-white lightning arced up and out, skittering across the churned water. Her skin sizzled. Teeth popped in her skull. Then a lightness, the familiar and alien grip of death, and she slipped into lifeless white.
