Bloodied and bereft, Hye stumbled out into the crowded palace grounds. Above, a great storm cell loomed, a towering cloud, black and furious, lit within by lightning pink and yellow. It was alone, lost, a dark ship among the brilliant cold blue of approaching night. To the western horizon, that sky shifted through lurid purple, pink, and orange to a rage red sun glaring like a wound. Koryo soldiers were everywhere. Royals and visitors poured out of their residences. Eshma and Msizi were weeping in the arms of several members of the Koryo council, their horror no longer contained by their terror.

“Ji-woo!” Hye’s shout was ragged with exhaustion and pain. She limped amid a widening circle. “Ji-woo! You coward. You cheat. You murder.” The words dripped, caustic. “Your Oni no longer protects you. Violet’s control of our home ends now!”

Ji-woo parted the crowd, thick guards surrounding him. His smirk was haughty as ever.

“Ah, Ward Hyeon, we are—”

“Save your lies.” She lowered herself into fighting stance, ribs and hips protesting as she did. “Vizier Daewoo!”

“Here, Hyeon. Here.” Daewoo trundled into view, her helper legs unsteady beneath her billowed robes. “Ah, Judges, good, I see the excitement, it seems, was good for summoning yourselves as my own. Ward, Prince—”

“Viceroy-*elect*, Vizier. Your bias—”

“My bias, your Excellency—*elect*,” retorted Daewoo, “is to the New Joseon Dynasty and Koryo. No one else. My loyalties are not on trial, and should there be a question, my judgement is not at hand. Theirs is.” She gestured to the Masters of the council.

Ji-woo turned to Hye, his face melting into false pity. “By the Golden Emperor, sister, you are half alive.” Each word was venom wrapped in honey. “It would be unfair to fight you in this condition.”

“You’re afraid.” Hye replied. Behind her, low rolls of thunder rumbled like drums of war. “Good.”

“Do not taunt me, sister,” said the Viceroy-elect, his words finding an edge. “You are clearly traumatized by whatever monster that Sifu of yours unleashed.”

“It’s not been dead a minute and already you know the story? So confident? Your Oni tell you what to say? She cannot fight for you, Ji-woo.”

“I do not need her!” He shrieked, then threw off his jacket and hiked his pant legs, lowering into readiness. “So be it. Gods know I’ve tolerated your vulgarity long enough, Ward. I am the *Viceroy-elect* and will be treated with the respect I have earned. You want a fight you have it. Judges. Vizier!”

Daewoo walked between them, her arms stretched, pushing them further apart with her will. To the masters, she bowed, then walked a circle, edging the crowd back, leaving the Ward and Prince alone in the center.
