Advika, a touch light-headed with drink and smoke, took in the remnants of the party. As others had succumb to fatigue to a tipple too many, their little table had held on. It had been decades since she had waded into the political shallows. One’s metaphors for the practice often betrayed one’s methods: a battle of wits; a game of deception; a hunter and quarry. Even within her metaphor of choice, turbulent waters, there was variation: some cast a net, others speared, while still others lure and line. Once, she would have said she fished with her hands, eating only what she caught. Going into the evening, her mission was simple enough: win support for Hye’s claim. Prove to the proxies of power that she and the Ward weren’t monsters from the Wilds; discredit the implications that they were the source of subterfuge; point out how convenient it had all been for Ji-woo. Rulers wield only as much power as others believe they have.

Outside of it, now, she realized the collision of elements from so many countries was something else entirely. It was a kind of chemistry. Bonds formed and split. Atoms became molecules and compounds, with new properties and potentials. The Inka and the Onzulu Ambassadors, unable to resist their mutual attraction, had dismissed themselves not five minutes apart and had both retired to the same room. Eshma remained sprawled, nearly supine, like a ninth Immortal, enveloped in a cloud of her own making. Winji, glittering and celestial, plucked a final sweet from her plate and admired it before popping it between her teeth.

“No early mornings for either of you, I see,” said the Sifu in false disparagement.

“We’ve no where to be,” retorted Eshma. “No Rajput clockwork schedules firing off at dawn. No document reviews or sub-committee meetings. For a Brahma-blessed week I’ve nothing to do but what the Koryo bid me do. I shan’t waste this golden opportunity with a reasonable bedtime.”

“To me it would seem you are as guilty,” said Winji. Her Nubian accent seemed to find the most lyrical meter and feet of every sentence. “And those two—” she gestured at the now empty seats—“the early leavers, likely lovers, are no more asleep than we.”

“I am jealous! What I would do for a tryst,” said Eshma.

Advika hoisted herself to standing with her staff. “And I could do with a night’s sleep in a real bed. It has been some time since I enjoyed conversation and company such as this. I look forward to continuing it over breakfast.”

“I have no intention of fasting,” said Eshma. “I shall be snacking all through the night.” She held up a small plate of samosas and baklava. “I do, however, very much look forward to our morning meal together!”

“Yes, as do I. Sifu I shall be shortly behind you. But I cannot leave Eshma to finish this coal on her own. Pass the pipe here, Eshma.”

Advika bowed, said her goodnights, and headed up the stairs to the residence rooms. From the mezzanine balcony, she looked out over the grand atrium. The great chandelier sparkled like a suspended galaxy in the fading firelight of the reception. Below, the two women, stars themselves with their outfits aglitter, were adrift in a hookah nebula. Sitting down with the Ambassadors had been a portal to her past. In the hours following the palace attack, the Onzulu had seemed the only rational destination. Yet the ancient arcology had, instead, come to her in the form of a petite, shrewd woman. How many years had it been since she last took the long ride into the mountain? Eshma and Winji took her back further still, her time among the Rajas and Pharaonic revivals. But none more than the Inka, Illapa. Those subtle questions, the effortless lies, the pastiche of the role she was attempting to play—Advika smiled—no doubt she was an agent of Condor Moray. But why? Grand ceremonies were always a worthy target of espionage or subterfuge, but what was Koryo to the Inkan Technocracy but a backwater? 

Enough, Advika, get to bed. She pushed back from the banister. Tomorrow would bring new light.

As she padded along the soft carpet runner of the second story’s hardwood floor, a trickle of ice ran down her spine. She froze, listening. Turning her head side to side, eyes closed, she focused on the sounds not coming from the hall, but those at her level, along the balcony wrapping it. On all four sides of the residence, the rooms were quiet. The mezzanine had not one long banister, but, in places, was ornamented with wooden walls and screens, carved to elegantly flow into the rise of the vaulted ceiling. She stilled her own breathing, and, in its absence, heard that of others. Her attention was, at first, pulled to the far side of the hall. Someone—a man?—breathing fast and hard, as if in a pitched fever. But it was a softer, gentler, nearer sound that gripped her most. Someone was waiting for her in her room.

Ji-woo, thought the Sifu, gripping her staff. What a fool I was to expect him to honor the challenge. That Vizier and I will need to recalibrate.

With a single swift motion she whipped the door open, staff ready to strike. There, on the bed, was Hye, napping. The little fusion, Trine, were draped across the nape of her neck. For an instant, she both the four year old orphan Advika had met all those years ago and the wilds-weathered woman who had out-gambled a relict of the Long War. Advika closed the door behind her and tapped her staff. Hye stirred.

“There you are,” she said, rubbing her eyes. The fusion, not fully waking, slid onto the bed. “I didn’t expect you to party so late.”

“I do as I please,” the Sifu added, a non-defense, “as it appears, *do you*. How did you even get in here?”

“You taught me, remember?”

Advika could deny little there. She locked the door, then crossed the room to the sitting area. From the console table, she selected a record, tilted it from its sleeve, and placed it on the turntable. Quiet and cozy music filled the room like a fog across the floor. Advika sat in one of the chairs, leaning her head back and closing her eyes. Hye scooped up Trine, carried them in a little pile in her two palms, sat in the chair across from her Sifu, and plopped the three-in-one mice onto her lap. For minutes, the two sat, listening to the ethereal zither and flute. Outside in the main hall, Eshma was singing her slurred goodnights to Winji.

“At least someone will get some sleep,” said Hye. “I wasn’t going to. All I could do was look at my door, waiting for some killer to open it.” 

Advika, head still reclined, gave a subtle *mmhmm*. 

“I thought you were an agent of his just now. Nearly came in swinging.”

“Is this what it was like?”

“Was what like this?”

“Your life before. Being a spy. Being an asura.”

The Sifu stiffened. Hye let the question hang in the air. Comforting herself, she scritched behind the ears of Trine’s top-most mouse, the others piled below. Amid the soothing tones, Hye could see the Sifu’s breathing had changed. Slower now, in and out through the nose—stillness out, storm within—remembering. Hye felt similar. Trine was the only proof anything that happened in the Wilds had been real. Even here, the attack on the Summer Palace felt like, not a nightmare, but a movie, a story she had seen, not lived. Certain scenes—the glass wall turning white, the guard rent apart, Sun being stolen from them, the Viceroy—were lurid, strobing into her mind’s eye in moments of idleness. But the rest blurred. The hunkering in the gallery, the stone passage, the long icy ride to Pyongyang were splotches of watercolor on dark paper. Even Daewoo’s injury was barely evidence enough.

“No,” the Sifu answered, leaning forward. “No, because before I was alone. Out there, among the ambassadors, it was like that, at times. As a spy, you’re with people, of course, but at odds, each of you wanting something. Charming strangers. That’s the job—coaxing while being un-coaxed. There were times where I had colleagues, lovers, and—” she sighed— “students. Rare, but humans, even asuras, make poor oysters. I needed a long time to learn that lesson. Much of this situation is *familiar*—forgive me the pun—but it is not what it was like. You are not a pawn, or a tool for me to use. You’re not a job either.”

“We’re a favor, Sun and I. To the old Viceroy.”

“That is how we met, yes, what brought me to Koryo. But that is not what you are to me. You, your sister, are part of me, and I, you. Little segments of our souls, mingled with one another. I feel the tug of hers, even now. How I wish that tension of hearts could turn a compass needle. Before you, long before, I was naive—fury-fed and justice misled. Ideas, causes, or nations—those great abstractions of the ‘good’—had my guile and my gun. If only I could eradicate all that opposed which ever good I was loyal to in that moment, then the world would be better.”

“Wouldn’t it have been?”

“We are all a bit broken, Hye. Though the geneticists swear by their tuning and the rearers their claims of pedagogy perfected, it’s guesswork—all of life is making do. We are finding our way through thicket and bramble. The paths, even the best and most beautiful, are neither straight nor smooth. And yet we rage at this—how dare we feel so lost, struggle so hard to towards a destination we cannot see. Exhausted, we find a path well trodden, set down by others, and follow. The destination, of course, is not what *we* desired, but what *they* did. Yet I was stunned by this! When I saw where my path had taken me, Hye, I fled. First into becoming an asura: deeper into the jungle, into caves, out to sea—anywhere but where I had been, where it seems all the others had wanted to go. Everywhere, I saw evil, darkness. Unable to destroy the darkness in myself, in my past, I fought it where I found it in the world. What good in me remained withered to a husk. In a final effort to destroy evil, I myself was almost obliterated. Helpless, I was rescued—forced to see the good of the world—when someone tender took me in.”

“Yi Min-yoon?”

“I wish you could have met her. My war had failed. The world was not evil, I realized, I was. So I surrendered. I hid. I could remove evil from the world by removing myself from it. But then Min-yoon came to my aid once again, asking me to pay the debt I owed her. It was only with you, with Sun, that I learned the source of my folly. The world is savage. Nothing is as ruthless as nature. Evil is as real as cancer. And yet the world is good, filled with kindness, and beauty. Min-yoon’s ask was simple. ‘Teach them to survive; Help them thrive.’ 

I had no idea how, but for the first time, I was not on a path pre-made, nor hacking through the brush alone. We were traveling together. My darker self, and each of yours, was not a threat or an ill to purge, but a facet, a phase of the moon. When the moon is bright and full, we can see its face, dark and light, the craters and lava fields, as well as the night world around us, our surroundings silver lit, like tonight. But on nights of a new moon, where the night is blackest, then the stars shine most brightly. 

The great unfairness of life is that we are all doing it for the first time. Our duty to one another is, as much as we can, is not to force others onto our path, but to help ease each other’s passage. Where they cross and run together, offer a helping hand, sit for a meal. I cannot stop the world from being cruel, but I could teach you to be strong, to face it, to be kind. I could not remove the ugliness, but I could teach you look past it, to celebrate beauty. I could not eliminate death or disease, but I could teach you to hold precious the joy of living. 

This is not what it was like, not at all. Then, I was alone and angry, a righteous demon, intent on the slaughter of evil. Evil remains. As do I. That much is the same. But the battle has changed. Would that our enemy was a mere monster, a mindless thing with no goal but violence and death. But those that took Sun, that control Ji-woo, Ji-woo himself, are no monsters—even those that most obviously seem to be. All are human. As are we. My purpose now is not to smother our darkness, but kindle our light.”

Hye blinked away tears. Never had she considered that her mere existence could carry such meaning. Nothing she had done, could ever do, would eclipse her simply being. In that moment, the world tilted, as though, looking to what she had thought was West she saw the sun rise.

“I… never knew.” It was all she could muster.

Advika closed her eyes, understanding, “I never told you.” 

Trine sat up, good ears rotating. Agitated, they hopped down from Hye’s lap, then cautious, padded towards the door. Ears were pressed to the door and snouts pushed under it. The hair raised along all of their spines. Footsteps outside in the hall, attempting to be silent, but lacking the grace required. Hye and Advika tensed as the door handle turned a slow fraction before meeting the resistance of the lock. The Sifu was already standing, when there was a small chime and a mute whir. The handle began again to turn. The fusion was a statue of fear. Advika clenched the handle and held it in place, her grip adamant. She pressed her other palm against the door, then shoulder, then leaned her full weight, bracing.

Hye beckoned Trine back, lifting it to her chest after it reached her feet. They shivered, albino-red eyes wide, ears flattened.

No blow ever came. But a sour odor seeped in under the door. Through the handle’s torque, Advika felt the would-be-intruder shift and push, trying to overpower her resistance. Risking some leverage and bracing, Advika pressed an ear to the door. Ragged breathing, repressed, deliberately shallow, but was undeniably there. Again, the mute chime and whir. Whomever it was thought the door was still locked—good. That meant they didn’t know *she *knew. For seconds that stretched like days, Advika waited to hear the threat recede. The smell worsened, stinging like cut onions. A last attempt, then a small huff of frustration, inches from where her head pressed to the heavy wood of the door, then uneven steps shuffled away down the corridor.

Advika pointed at one of the chairs, then the door. Hye set Trine on the bed, then brought over the chair and with aching slowness, set it against the door. Advika made two more hand signals: she, the light switch, Hye, the record player. They moved. First, the room went dark, then quiet. The shush of the speakers as minute vibrations in the air thrummed the suspended needle. Hye dared not do more. 

Both made their way to the wall shared with the room next door, in the direction of the footsteps, and pressed their ears to it. For minutes, nothing. Only their breaths and the pounding of their hearts.

Then it came. 

A yelp, doubly muffled through the wall and something else—hand, pillow?—just as suddenly cut off. An instant of thrashing followed, as though a sleeper turning over violently amid a terrible dream. It lasted only seconds.

Quiet reigned again.
