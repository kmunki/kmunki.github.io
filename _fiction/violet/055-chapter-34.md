“We,” said the Host, “are the Zuqqum.”

Inside the lit glass globes, the heads turned and shifted. Their gazes flickered to Hye, then the Sifu, then elsewhere. Each was, like the host, only half skulled, brain open to the agar. For several of them, the wrinkly pink overflowed the edges of its boney home. Some heads were withered, shrunken, as though jarred for preservation. A few had young faces, hardly older than Hye. Their necks were connected to an array of tubes which lead out to the chandelier. 

Such was each: a head in a jar, with a cable running from the mind up and tubes running from the neck down, like an egg held between finger and thumb. 

The Host made her way to a large, comfortable chair where she sat, putting up her feet onto an ottoman. The blue leather had been meticulously cared for, as had everything in the room, but for the first time Hye could truly see the *age *of this place.

“Where did you get all the furniture?” Hye blurted.

“Where,” the host was almost stunned. Then she started laughing, long and hard. Flickers of smiles and crows feet raced and rippled across the faces of heads. Advika was nonplussed.

“The furniture!” The host exclaimed, trying to control her laughter, “oh dear, oh yes. You *are *a strange one. We had hopes, dreams, bets even, that you’d turn out this way, but it’s such a treat to see it, no, not just see, to *experience, *to be with,* *the totality. What a question! So curious! Not about our heads, or the experiments, or how we’ve survived here for a century, or the dozens of other practical questions. Though which questions, eh? Where would one start? It is a question, but contained, restrained. We cannot answer it forever, or dissemble and dodge. We, I think, are the lucky ones for your arrival.

But to the question itself. They were, are, gifts, offerings, tribute. Our facility, our home, this”—the Uyasimi waved her hands at the space around them—“tower, yes this Tower, is afforded a certain reverence by the locals. Not worship! No no. More… homage, deference. There is fear there, yes, and we have been called names that are more monstrous than divine, but not demonic. Atavistic? Reverential! You might wonder why we accept? Take the little train depot from which you departed. It is not the only town out here. There are many little hamlets within a few days ride of here, plus Novy Urengoy has recovered enough you might call it a city.”

“A *city*? In the Wilds…” said Hye, looking to Advika who stood in a silence beneath which brewed a blend of emotions Hye could not read, something like fury at someone attempting to assuage raw grief, “not beyond battery towns. None can survive out here.”

“No cities! Civilization can’t be in the Wilds!” mimicked the Host, mocking, “your Sifu, we think, might know otherwise. Besides, I have my tea set from there.” She gestured over to a gorgeous, delicate porcelain set in a hutch that, like so much of the room’s finery, was a bit out of place. “Not that they *made *it, no, but they found it. Recovered it. Much to recover! Not just things. Ideas. Memories. Dreams. The dead cities of the Wilds are quite good at feeding and supplying the still living ones. Novy *was *gone, it’s true. But, as you must know, Sifu, they are not the *only *survivors? Others thought Lost escaped the Long War.”

Advika raised an eyebrow.

The Host chuckled, but the heads in their agar jars turned slowly, one and all, haphazardly as to not be obvious, to regard the old woman. Curious gazes, scrutinizing ones, peered out at her through the red-orange gel.

“We, how to say this? Where to start, what to say? You are *familiar*. We feel as though you are one of us, one of our own, if not kinship certainly kith-ship, no? You feel it, yes yes, you know this too. You are old, but not so old as you seem. Older? Bah!” The Host shouted. “Who *are *you? Were you? Our memories we sift and sift and they blur together. You are in them, among them. More than a Sifu!”

“I was an agent within the Shadow for a long time for many powers,” said Advika, finally. “Our paths crossed, once or twice, though that was when I was much younger, a much different person.” 

Advika scrutinized the heads of the Zuqqum, ignoring the Uymasi Kurku. A person outside may be calm, placid, where within each of us is a parliament of argument. For the Zuqqum, this debate was made manifest. Waves of surprise, revelation, conclusion, dismissal, disbelief, and delight all rippled across the faces. But he agar obscured, the glass distorted—only half were visible at any time. Still, it was more mind-reading than most could hope for. A consensus seemed to be reached.

“Ahhh,” said the Host, her face a mask of serenity over a strange glee, “well then. But *you,*” she said, addressing Hye, “you we do recognize. You, we think, we know, we remember, you are *Lucky*.”

Hye’s eyes dropped to her little finger and its half-ring scar. She then looked up and, as if for the first time, around the room. Memories fought for her senses, her vision shifting from what lie before her to rememberings.

“You keep saying that, just the way the Curator did. What does it mean?”

“Ask the old war-born asura, she knows.”

“*Asura?*” Hye interjected, looking back and forth from the Host to her Sifu, “*War-born? *as in? Sifu?”

“It is a guess, but a good one, we think, oh, yes,” said the Host, leaning back in her chair, “Your Sifu is special, unique, different. Those eyes! Shimmering violet. Rare eyes. We have seen before and, oh memories, they deceive, but we remember those eyes. And some of us were there, there during the first, when asuras were born. Would you like to share our knowledge of them?”

From the walls, ceiling, and floors wooden arthropodish arms emerged. Through gaps in the panels, Hye could see the sinew and enervation. As the Host spoke, the arms moved as she did, an extension of her, of the Zuqqum.

“We do not want your bargain.”

“You are not a we! *She”—*Kurku pointed at Hye—“is not *you*. Not yet. Do you want to know child? What you are? What she is? Why you are hunted? Why your sister was taken and why a cuckoo sits on your throne?”

“You know what happened to Sun?”

“Hye! No!” Advika shouted.

But Hye continued, “Tell me! I want to know!”

A wave of something like pleasure spread over the faces.

“Oh, Hyeon,” the Sifu said, defeated.

Two sets of arms hanging from the ceiling slid along their hidden tracks to the chandelier of heads. They set to furious work, unscrewing, disconnecting, and unclasping.

“Do not fret, old asura,” said the Kurku, “you are both too precious. I must have you. The process is painless, I assure you.”

The arms lowered from the ceiling. Within their wooden, semi-skeletal hands, were two empty jars, ready for fresh heads.
