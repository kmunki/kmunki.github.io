Ward and Sifu were, for a moment, blinkered by the startling brightness of the otherwise serene entry-room. Trine began wiggle and jitter within Hye’s pocket, attempting to extricate themselves. With little reason to imprison the treble-mouse, she unlatched her pocket. Offering a mitten as elevator, she lowered them to the warm, polished floor. Instead of scrabbling over to the host, who had herself knelt to offer a hand, Trine skittered at first to the door of the small garage. Finding that now closed, they hurried back across the floor and took up position behind Hye’s feet.

The woman stood, a mocking frown on her face.

“Now that’s unkind. Forgive their manners. We had something of a tiff, a fight, an argument, a confusion — a tiff, a few days ago. Such a tiff! Over such minor things. Isn’t that always the way. And now me! Manners. I forget ourselves! We welcome welcome. I am the Uyasimi, a term you likely do not know, it has fallen from use. Was it ever in use? We don’t know. So much time, passing passing. We use it, so it is in use, though rare. Rare use. A rare title! I am Kurku the Uyasimi. You may think of me, though, as a Host. As your host, here, and as a Host.”

Hye tried to focus on the woman’s round, polished face, which shone as though carved from glossy mahogany. She was barefoot. She wore long, flowing ticivara robes of a pale blue green, their long sleeves and waterfalls of fabric reminding Hye of the saffron-colored kasaya robes of Buddhist monks. There was something almost tropical to the attire, its open breeziness as startling a contrast to the frozen world beyond the door. So too the bright lights and calm quiet to the storm-tossed darkness outside. Her eyes smiled and she wore an expression of placid kindness. 

All of these details, to be found in a person happily greeting expected guests — in what had been assumed to be an abandoned war facility far lost to the Siberian wilds; to which they had escaped unannounced and unplanned — were strange. Had this been all to the woman, this Kurku, Hye would have felt unmoored, surreal, as if she might be hallucinating her: a blizzard mirage. 

But this was not all.

The Host had no hair. Of course baldness, be it monastic, fashion, or imposed by nature is not so uncommon as to be startling. Given the circumstances, it may have gone unnoticed were it not that, just above her eyebrows, there was an equatorial seam which passed over ears and wrapped around globe of her head. Above this seam, skin and bone stopped and replaced with what, at first glance, appeared little more than glass. Within was the visible brain, encased in the reddish-orange of agar. From the top rear a great bundle of wires and tubes ran into a long cable, perhaps a thumb’s thickness, that connected to the ceiling. Mounted to a long rail, it seemed able to gather and extend as she moved about the space. Beneath the clear cap, the cable it splintered in to thousands of filaments that embedded into the woman’s mind.

Kurku unselfconsciously touched the cable, almost caressing it as an acknowledgement of, *oh this? Yes I suppose you must be curious.*

“Welcome,” she said again. Her voice was not unpleasant, but there was a queerness to its emergence, with perfect diction and yet an alien accent. “Thank you for returning our friend here. They had…” the hosts eyes, unfocused, staring into the middle distance, then returned to Trine, “been turned out rashly. We regretted the decision the moment we saw the weather turning. But no matter, all is resolved.

My manners! I apologize. It has been sometime since we have had guests and our graces are somewhat in disuse. My name is Kurku, I am the Uyasimi — yes yes you know, but repetition is kind, you may not remember! We will forget, at times, or remember too much, the memories piling like snow on snow on river ice, not-yet-frozen water below, clouds above. How to tell them apart! So much water, so much white!  This is our home, it is us. Was a military facility. Once new but new no longer. We use it. We are it. We hear, create and improve, refine, iterate, modify, adjust, tune, inhabit — ah! That function has not changed, although the many militaries for which we once created are no longer. Though, no news of news for some time now, ha! Guests, as you may have guessed, are rare and, thus, so too, is news, though our mutual friend and a few others had attempted to remedy that in various ways. Yours are not the only cinder hawks and a mesh vault sutured along the spine is light and well—“

“Thank you for welcoming us, Uyasimi Kurku” said Advika, interrupting with a bow of thanks “I do not meant to be rude, but we are being chased. We came seeking… safety.” Advika’s pause surprised even herself. A calculated reveal, generate empathy and buy time. “Our pursuers, though delayed in the storm, will be here soon. We were lucky to come across your—”

“Lucky! We see,” said the Host, “these are Wilds, you are lost! From the town! Battery town, we know we know, others have, will, come. But first, manners manners!”

Hye stepped forward, “Thank you for welcoming us, Uyasimi Kurku. I am Ward Yi Hyeon Bong-cha of the New Joseon Dynasty of Koryo, an honorable member of the Continuum. You have met my teacher and master, Sifu Advika Shidao, Royal Rearer and advisor to the Viceroy Her Highness Yi In-yeong.”

For the first time, the Host’s eyes seemed to sharpen into focus. She had, Hye realized, been looking toward them, but not at them. Now the woman’s gaze was like a probing needle, darting and stabbing. She seemed to reach a decision and, from a sash around her waist, removed something. Clutching it close, she bowed.

“Ward Hyeon Bong-cha, Sifu Shidao, it is our honor. We are too are lucky! What chance you are here! Guests guests, so rare, so lovely, to be hospitable. But sad, military, you know, so secure. We must consult, though in charge, yes, but we don’t make all the decisions. No one does! Plans, they change! So much changes. Cannot predict. Cannot guess. Only hope, only try to influence. You will wait, I shall ask!”

Kurku held up the little item, a disk of come kind. She held it pressed between her curled fingers and thumb, then, leveling her fist, looked down the edge of it as though it were the iron sights of a rifle.

“I…” said Hye, “I have seen one of those before.”

“It is unlikely,” said Kurku, dismissive, but then paused, some parts of her wanting to hear more.

“The edge…it’s beautiful,” Hye stepped closer. She leaned forward, her face almost touching the disc. Kurku did not move. The edge was a faceted sapphire, cut such that the minor tremors of the Host’s own breath down her bones caused the light to dance and sparkle unendingly, as though it were an infinite waterfall, forever shimmering in a pure beam of sun.

“When I was a little girl, when I was Chosen from my village,” Hye hesitated, trying to remember, her voice far away, “one of the representatives, the Curator I think, she took me to a part of the train car away from others. There… there was a test of some kind. But the device it… half worked… it broke, got stuck. I was cut,” Hye held up her hand, the crescent scar visible on her finger, ”but she seemed to find that good, hopeful. She had one of those… a disc, on a necklace. One side was blue and green, the earth from far away, the oceans and land. I had never seen anything so beautiful, white clouds, the dark of the mountains. On the other, reds and pinks and yellows: a cell. I don’t know how I remember this — it feels like yesterday, so clear. I could see the nucleus, the spindles, it was ready to divide. Maybe it was a zygote, a new life, a first cell. She never told me, I only saw each side for a moment as she took it from the necklace. The edges were shimmery, like yours, but not cut gem. More like crushed diamond, it was in clumps, like salt on the rim of a glass.”

Both the Host and Sifu were silent, rapt.

“She held it to me, as you just did, then flipped it.”

Hye pantomimed the action, then snatched the air where the imagined coin would have been.

“But the other woman, a bureaucrat, she grabbed it. The Curator seemed very distressed, but did not say anything. The bureaucrat fiddled with the disc, we could not see which side was up. The Curator demanded it back. The bureaucrat was dismissive, so handed it back to the Curator with an exaggerated bow, the disc vertical between two fingers, her palm up.”

Hye went quiet, remembering. A reverence had fallen over the room.

“The curator took it, somewhat stunned. Than was herself again, haughty. As she walked away, she said I was lucky. But not in a regular way. Like it was a title, the way you said Uyasimi. I had never heard the word before, but I knew it was important, that it had special meaning. That was how she said it: Lucky.”

Kurku took a step back, lowering her hand. An odd smile appeared on her face, as if the funniest notion had just struck her.

Hye felt Advika’s hand on her shoulder.

“Why,” she asked, in a hesitant whisper, “had you never told me that story?”

“I didn’t know it was important,” said Hye, almost in a daze, the intensity of the memory lingering, keeping her from the present. “I’m not sure even I remembered it until now. When I saw how it… the light… the way she held it, I remembered. I haven’t even thought about it. So many new things happened then.”

“We thank you, deeply, for the story, Ward Hyeon Bong-cha,” said the Host. “Please, follow me. Your name has flickers, old ideas, memories, forgotten, like your story, that we, too, had known and not known we had known. It is,” she laughed, “lucky! Lucky of course it is lucky that our coin should have touched such a space in your mind, that you would share. Pieces! There was a puzzle we were putting together, none of us aware of the pieces. 

Do not worry Sifu Advika! Precautions have been made, Sifu, for you, for safety, though limited. Those who pursue are far, far, far. We are not in such a rush. The storm is substantial. We have an enormous amount to discuss, to determine, to understand, together. We would like you to meet us first. Manners manners!”

Kurku led them down a long hall way. As she walked, the clasps holding the cable attached to her head seemed to anticipate her movements, such that she was not pulling, but always had a bit of slack. Kurku narrated the entire way. 

The interior of the facility itself was quite different from the castle-like exterior. Like something out of a pre-war novel of science and experimentation, Hye thought, from the age of adventure and alchemy. Beautiful wood and ornate brass embellishments, glass flasks and magnifying lenses. Dozens of doors, most closed, flanked their path, each with small brass plates embossed with delicate decorative writing. Some she recognized: armory, nursery, broodery. Most she did not. Though the aesthetic was one of pre-war, the technology seemed, at a glance, war-relic. Where the doors were open she saw glowing terminal screens and busy whiteboards, showing diagrams of immense complexity. The technology seemed as though it belonged hundreds of years in the future, not a century old. Entire walls were screens, displaying data and statuses and translucent enough to see that which was behind, rooms of wood-clad robotic arms engaging in deliberate, planned experimentation.

What most astounded though was when the host lead them up a long spiraling staircase. They were ascending the Tower! They came up through the floor into the atrium. It was ornate, rich czarist architecture, with gold filigree, rich dark woods, and heavy red, white, and yellow carpets and drapes, thick with rope edging and tassels. Much of it seemed to cover over existing more modern and minimalistic styling, creating an odd sense of being decorated twice, like the Mexica building atop and around the pyramids at Teotehuacan. As the old city can be seen beneath the new, so too, here. At the center of the room was a kind of chandelier, or the shape of one anyway, an inverted cone of sorts. It was massive, hung with large glass spheres, polished and pristine, somewhere between twenty and fifty of them. The globes, similar to incubation pods, were connected with hundreds tubes drawing up and in towards the chandelier’s center. 

“Hello,” said the Kurku the Uyasmi, as if for the first time, “it is so nice to meet you.”

With her words, the huge chandelier illuminated. Every sphere lit up, glowing a reddish golden, the color of lit agar. 

Within each sphere was a human head, staring out at her.
