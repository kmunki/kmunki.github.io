The two tiger sharks circled, rolling to the side, their awful dolls eyes interrogating. A great shadow passed through the water above the dome. Serpent feathers, thought Illapa, what was that? The sharks dipped below the surface and were gone. Deep in the water, far below, a flicker of light. With it, a shadow, darker than the midnight depths surrounding; it rose, growing. Far above, sun and the lights of the city strained and refracted through the water. Under this glamor the shadow thickened and resolved into a huge shape nearly the length of the opening. Spotlights blinded Illapa and Biby, throwing the rest into darkness. A blasting rush of breath and sea water sprayed up into the dome as the surface broke, followed by the great in-rush of air filling cavernous lungs.

Illapa tried to see beyond the glare, to what was there beyond. The ripples from its surfacing bounced and rebounded against her shins and the moon pool edge, creating a shifting pattern in which the great stillness of the being contrasted. Glimpses—of metal, of skin—were all she could get. Here and there, flares of orange light would dart across, illuminating mere inches, like fireflies on a mountain.

“I catch spy! Please!” said Biby, the words bursting out, “bring to you.”

*Oh, *realized Illapa, *this *is the Olokun*.*

“Hello, noble Olokun.” Illapa erred toward the generic honorific, a safe bet.“Your agent, Biby, did indeed catch me. Though I caught her as well.”

Low creaks, like a fiber cord stretched too tight, came from the shadow. Then a deep basso rumble and a long, low mournful note, punctuated by a coda of clicks.

“A bold gambit,” said the Olokun, in a deep, synthetic voice that seemed to come all directions, “but a fatal one. My eyes and ears are omnipresent. I know your story. You watched the scientist and followed. Those who paid to have her watched will be informed. A banal task, as our craft goes, but the coin spends the same. By coming here you have complicated matters. Clients rarely know who I am, that Biby lead you down here is unlikely to result in your leaving alive. But,” a small huff of air came from the blowhole, “that you were savvy enough to do so at all is intriguing. I shall tolerate your attempt to persuade me that you have something of merit to share. Either I will be informed or entertained, so little is lost to me either way.”

Illapa nodded and stood, indifferent. With casual boredom, as if she had already done this a few times today, she began to pace the rim of the dome. The Olokun’s eye followed. She prayed it could not hear her heart pounding.

“I’m glad to hear it,” Illapa replied, desperate to keep the terror and amazement in her voice in check. This was no normal hybrid. She felt as though she was talking to one of the gods of old, like an audience with the sea itself, asking for safe passage. “Moreover, I’m glad,” she continued, “to hear that all your spies have been as deceived as poor Biby. While sad for Biby, you and I will both find value here. In that I, *and I alone*, have deduced this gem of information.”

The spotlights followed, rotating, keeping her blinded and the Olokun in shadow.

“Biby’s a decent little spy, though when faced with a professional she’s little match. And as I am to Biby, ten-fold again is our shared pray. For I, too, was not interested in Tir, not directly.”

“Only physically, then?”

Illapa froze. How did… Biby had not yet said anything. There was no gap in which she could report what she had seen. 

“Clever.” Carry on, Illapa, ignore the taunt. “She was my quarry’s quarry, and as with you, I too sought to know who might be following her. Yet *I *could see the true object of your interest, while Biby could not. Might you know why that is?”

“You are lying?” Said the Olokun, rhetorical. “A diversion.”

“Could be could be,” Illapa admitted, “a reasonable deduction.” She lingered, then asked, “What do you know of asuras?”

A blast of briny air burst from the whale, a cetacean scoff. Creaks and clicks pitched high, then sank and stretched, undulating, before returning to a mid-point stop.

“Asuras! Do not mistake minion for master. I am no humble hybrid, but pure uplift.” Illapa froze, unable to subdue her astonishment. “Yes, an Inka like you knows better than any the meaning there. Thick my blood and brain are with agar, my biology buttressed. Like asuras, my existence is myth—I am well aware of those war-relics, those cousin creations of desperation. Unlike you, pretender, I know them, and though they are few, *none* are invisible. But please, tell me how my Biby was deceived where you were not.”

Illapa stammered. Uplifts were borderline fairy tales. Archives at Condor had records of such experiments and detailed records of those that succeeded, but that was mid-war. In the extreme rarity of success, uplifts reached pinnacles of intelligence, strength, and lifespan fabled in magic elixirs. Rumors uplifts ruled Kongo, Alyeska, Hamazan—great hybrid cities within the Wilds—were perhaps the only thing more mythological than the uplifts themselves. Impossible. Despite the evidence before her: the obvious external enhancements, the baroque syntax, the voice and size of the whale itself, she found herself almost unable to believe that she was even looking upon, let alone conversing this ancient being.

“Biby,” said Illapa, seeking some momentary respite to recover herself, “what did you feel when I told you to look?”

“Please! Don’t want to look,” said Biby, her voice tremulous, “Afraid. Was like predator. Persian, yes, ok. Other… please! Biby hated, Biby scared.”

A deep *mmmmmm* vibrated the water.

“Hideyo Hirohito,” said Illapa, confidence returning, “is your true target. I am not sure entirely how she does it—pheromones, subvocalization, body language—Biby could not bear to even look, I was paralyzed with primal terror. She was no easy woman to miss, I’d wager a guess”—she was speculating now—a risk—“that she used that same… whatever it was to ensure whole crowds missed her, turned away, as though she were actively uninteresting. A blank space in the cluster. Not invisible, no, but weaponized disinterest. None of your agents will have noticed her actions, let alone her following the Persian and then taking her. But I suspect they will have reported seen her in Nairobi, from afar only. You know, you must know, that such talents are among rumored asura abilities.”

She had played every card. A wild, ridiculous bet. Ursine would be proud if she lived long enough to tell her about it. An entire mission wagered on the chance that not one but two things were true: Hideyo *had *in fact, been spotted and, more over, that the Olokun’s information was at least as good as Vidya’s. No mission succeeds without luck. It was foolish to rely on it alone, but treat it as a tool, a necessary, practical one to be used with caution, you might survive.

“Interesting,” said the Olokun, “it would seem you *are* more than I anticipated. And that means we have much to discuss indeed.”
