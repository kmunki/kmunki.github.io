<div class="novel-intro" markdown="1">

Set in a post-apocalyptic world where Zheng He's westward expansion prevented European colonization, leading to the catastrophic Long War, *Violet* follows Hye—a supernaturally "Lucky" young woman whose fortune has been engineered by the ancient Society of Opportunists. As she evolves from sheltered Korean royal ward to Shadow operative, she must confront the ultimate question: can enhanced individuals escape the purposes for which they were created?

## The Story

In an alternate present day, Hye is a royal ward of Koryo, raised alongside her ambitious royal-born sister Sun by their enigmatic Sifu—a wizened retired spy. Beyond the safety of the palace walls are the Wilds, weaponized bio-engineered ecosystems, and the 'civilized' superpower nations locked in a brutal cold war. Despite these dangers, Hye longs for adventure in the world beyond, while her sister plots to rule it.

When Sun is sent to the edge of the Wilds on a mission for the Koryo crown, Hye joins her. On their journey, Hye accidentally reveals a power sought by Violet, a biotech corporation and nation in one. Ruthless and cunning, Violet brazenly attacks the palace to get what it wants. In the mayhem, Sun is abducted and Violet secretly seizes rule of Koryo. Hye escapes into the only place safe from Violet: the Wilds. Now, with her Sifu's help, Hye must survive monstrous Wilds and find a way to stop Violet. If she can't, Sun, Koryo, and eventually the world will be lost to Violet's shadow empire.
