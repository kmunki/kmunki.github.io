As escapes go, it was not particularly exciting; difficulties arose, there were moments of stress. No one stopped them, however, and no one would. To leave a train in the middle of the Wilds was inconceivable. Clear, well known consequences, underlined and reinforced by the massive gun installments and armored wall encircling what could barely be described as a town, should have been sufficient. No one was supposed to get on or off. It was not a stop. And yet, for Ward and Sifu, it was, had to be, so they did.

Nor was the town itself all that appealing. It looked as though a glacier had recently run over it. A near full charge from everything else, it was an embassy of the civilized world, a signature stamp’s worth of dirt that claimed both heritage of and allegiance to great cities—cities which none of its inhabitants would ever visit nor be visited by. Alien, yet belonging, battery towns were little more than a permanently lived-in charging station in the worst neighborhoods in the world.

After a few false starts, Advika managed to find what passed for the general store. To Hye’s untrained eye, it appeared to be a moderately well-organized hoarder’s home. The proprietor was desperately thin woman, tall and knobby. Her skin was near the darkest Hye had ever seen, but her features gave little away as to her other heritage. Her attire didn’t help. A combination of flowing colored robes and heaps of jewelry—bangles and rings, necklaces and chains—such that she shimmered and jangled as she sprinted and gesticulated among her wares. Speech, too, was untraceable, eclectic. Words and syntax and idioms had been collected from, it seemed, every visitor she had ever had, which was apparently hundreds.

Hundreds of people, passing through a place no one was supposed to ever travel to or leave.

The prices were insulting and the gear would probably fail but they needed a chance. Advika began listing items, the proprietor’s grin straining such that Hye thought it would circle to the back of the woman’s head and the top would slide off. At the mention of the final item, the woman shot off jangling through the store. Backpacks, tents, bedrolls, sleeping bags, began to pile up in twos, each small, compacted, and battered. A ghoulish tickling ran up Hye’s spine. Much of this gear, she realized, had been recovered for resale upon its previous purchaser’s failure to survive.

The old Sifu picked up each item, poking it, sticking her hand in this pocket, pressing on that seam, tugging at a zipper and yanking on some strap. If something was packed, she unpacked it, tried it on. When a camp stove appeared, with paired bioheat generator, the Sifu dragged it out into the freezing wind of the street and made the proprietor fire it up. Then shut it off. Then Advika did both steps. Then Hye. She insisted it burn, within their view through the side window, while the rest of the deal was made, charging a dead battery. Full-body qaliq parkas, with fur and seal skin grown inside of a modern waterproof and tear-resistant woven rubberized canvas, were added. Hye was ordered to run, walk, tumble, and kata back and forth along the empty wind-blasted street where the camp stove burned, its flames shredded horizontal, until she was sweating, little crystals forming on exposed hair and skin. Every item was given the same inspection and, though ripped, gnawed, or stained, each was found functional and acceptable.

Next came transport: a snowmoto, as dinged and scuffed as they had come to expect, but that would play just as nice on the frozen rivers and lakes as it did two feet of fresh powder. Advika, clad in her not-yet-paid-for qaliq, started the snowmoto and drove off, the spiked twin front tires and rear treads first crunching, then roaring through the snow. She returned and tested plugging both solar cells and bio stove into it, testing the charge while increasingly indignant store owner watched.

Finally, Advika asked for something that made both the proprietor raise an eyebrow of mixed skepticism and respect. The woman nodded and, now with a calm, quiet stride, went behind a curtain into a back room. Out she came with two covered cages. She set them on the counter and removed one cover. It was a hawk. Of sorts. 

Not quite, Hye realized. 

Take a hawk, give it a mane like a lion and a big bushy tail like a fox, but of inordinately thick, glossy fur, like an otter. Advika explained as she inspected that they were a true oddity, unique to this region. In addition to the specialized feather-fur, they had the ability to modulate thermoregulation and bring their body temperature up to a near fatal fever when needed and *survive* it for hours on end. She took the fluffy hawk out of the cage, giving it a scrap of meat, petting its mane and feeling its bones. Hoisting the bird now perched on her fist, she scrutinized it eye-to-eye. 

She opened the door and with a flick of her arm sent the hawk off into the storm. The proprietor’s mouth hung open, a protest having died in her lungs.

“Cinder hawks have a kuvasz-like blend of independence and loyalty,” the old Sifu explained as she peered out the windows, searching. “They’re irritating to train, but excellent at interpreting commands. They feed themselves and bring little things here and there back, but mostly they eat enough to land inside your jacket and augment your body heat. Helps with not freezing to death when you’re driving eighty kilometers an hour in the everlasting dark of a Mongolian winter. Ah!”

She opened the door and stuck out her arm. For a moment, she seemed to only be antagonizing the store owner further, allowing a small drift of snow to form just inside, when the hawk landed and, with a bang, the door closed. With a few swift, practiced motions, Advika set the hawk on the perch and closed the cage, leaving the cover off. The hawk held a little creature, some kind of hairy beetle the size of a thumb, in its talons. Unmolested, it set to ripping its catch apart and eating it. The routine was repeated with the second hawk. Upon its successful return, Advika added them to her list of acquisitions.

“Pick one,” said the old Sifu.

Hye looked at the two, picking the second, which had not caught anything and, therefore, was especially friendly when offered a scrap of meat. She named her Jujeonja, Juju for short. A mottled white, not quite the pure white of an arctic fox or a ptarmigan, the hawk had the coloring more reminiscent of a gray seal. The two, together, rapidly learned that treats of fish jerky resulted from little tricks or when Juju hunkered close and fluffed her tail around Hye’s cold neck.

The final provisions were laid out, various jerkies, powders, and other high density foodstuffs that, when mixed with melted snow or, in desperation, saliva, created a sustaining gruel. As each item had been tested and verified, the old Sifu had moved it to the far side of the counter, presenting each thing unpacked, visible, so that all items were accounted for, including the hawks. After these few hours of intense scrutiny, the proprietor was exhausted. 

Or seemed so, until the negotiations began. 

At the mention of currency, she was as sharp and shrewd as before. The grey-haired, purple-eyed Sifu and the jangling, gold-grinning store owner engaged in a dance of deception and decision the Ward nor townie could not follow. At various moments, there was derisive laughter, name calling, the Sifu walking into the storm, pacing, hands slammed on to the counter, whispers, casual leaning with relaxed gestures, and a dozen other rituals and performances. In the end, though, they settled on a price. Both seemed drained and a bit frustrated, the sign of an excellent compromise. 

As the actual payment occurred, however, Advika first waited for the proprietor to count her currency and cigarettes (the one item of barter she seemed to truly desire). When the woman nodded, frowning, that *yes, it’s here, take your things*, the old Sifu grabbed the woman’s hand, not with aggression, but intention. She held the woman’s gaze, locking eyes. Slowly, she layered several more bills onto the stack. With the last one, she pressed her hand onto the entire stack, sandwiching the bills and the woman’s hand between hers and said, “It is a shame we have never met. You seem wonderful. Thank you.”

For the first time in hours, the proprietor did not jangle. She was still and speechless. An eyebrow raised and, with it, the corner of her mouth in a subtle smile. A single dip of her head, more than a nod, not quite a bow, and Advika removed her hands. The woman took the bills and set them into a drawer, and, locking it, gestured to a door that lead not quite outside.

“You may make yourselves ready in the stable, the snowmoto is waiting for you. I hope one day we meet…“ she cut herself off, the *again *implied, its silence an assent to the unspoken agreement. 

There was, also, a tone of caution, as her eyes darted to the rips and tears in the gear.
