Winji’s cry was fast muffled to a whimper. Half-dried blood clung to her neck—its source—and her side, where she had lain in a congealing crimson pool. Hye had found her, first heard her whispered plea of *help*, more a sharp punctuated breath than any kind of speech. No deliberation was needed, she would come with them to the panic room. In lifting her, the wound was forced to stretch and in pain she found her voice, yelping. Only a half second, but enough. Whatever it was that had chased agent and ambassadors from their rooms would now becoming for them.

That it was a ‘whatever’* *was, in no small part the problem. In the strained moments after it had attempted to enter their room, Sifu and Ward had debated what the threat even was. They faced difficult choice: not if they should abandon the meagre safety of the room with the hope of achieving real fortification by first passing through absolute danger of the great hall—that was evident—but when and how. An assassin might attempt the room adjacent, to come in through some shared bathroom, or vent. Or what if it had merely been a drunk partier, looking for one room, finding the other, and crawling into bed roughly. 

The hushed debate might have continued had screams from the hall not both answered their question and decided their action. The Sifu held out a hand, *wait*, but the guilt of the victim next door clung to Hye, she would not abandon others to the same fate. Within moments, she was in the darkened hall, her teacher following, the fusion nestled in her pocket.

In the time it took to take in the scene, it was all but over. On the opposing balcony, across the vast chasm of the darkened great hall and half obscured by the shimmering silhouette of the chandelier, two brilliant rectangles of light from two open room doors. From one, the sounds of battle. From the second, emerged two women, huge bundles of sheets and clothes in their arms. 

“Msizi, Eshma—” said Advika, her whisper clipped by a monstrous bellow and battering sounds from the far room. Each moment of what happened next was too confused and rapid to process. The women on the stairs—a door slam and someone—the Inkan?—holding it shut as *something *fought to get out—the door flying open—horrific confused and furious shrieking—the Inkan following the ambassadors to the kitchen?

When it emerged, a hunched silhouette framed in the yellow square of room light, Advika’s hand gripped Hye’s shoulder, holding her student in place. A man-that-was-no-longer-a-man stumbled into the hall, frantic, sweeping its gaze before hearing the Inkan’s footfalls on the bottom stairs. Manic, it scrambled and loped down the stairs, half-falling, half-leaping, crashing to the landing and pursuing into the kitchen. 

Then nothing, quiet. Only haunted moans of frustration and the scratching of metal.

The Sifu held a single finger to her lips, purple irises vivid with eyeshine. In the sudden silence, Hye could hear her own sharp nasal exhalations and the pounding in her chest. It was the ogumo again, some brutal war-relic appearing here, a vestige of the Wilds and Long War causing mayhem and pain for a simple reason: her. How could the Zaqqum, could Li Xing, could anyone, consider *her *lucky. 

The Sifu started down the corridor, pressed into the corner away from the balustrades, ensuring they were all but invisible from below. Hye followed. Room doors hung ajar, in a state of violation. Within, where moonlight spilled in through open shades, Hye could see the ruined bodies—throats torn out, stains of blood, static crimson waterfalls, across sheets. Some had fought back, crawled to the floor, to die there. Others looked almost at peace, as if they hadn’t woken up in time to know they were dying. Bloody handprints on doorframes and banisters, where the killer had rested, exhausted from slaughter. Drippings had blotched hall carpet, gory footprints tracked between.

Amid this came Winji’s almost inaudible whisper. The Nubian had suffered the same assault as others, but not the same fate. Still, she breathed. Hye and Sifu together knelt next to her. There was no deliberation, she would come with. Not one more would die. Her dark skin, exsanguinated, was ashen in the moonlight. Her desperate hand put pressure on her neck. A pillow case looped from nape to opposite armpit and tied there helped to staunch. Arms draped over their shoulders, her rescuers stood. The cry came. Winji had felt it rising, and could not stop it. A sharp burst of sound, then muted by her pain-pressed lips.

Hye looked over the woman’s lolling head to her Sifu.

“It will have heard that,” said the old asura.

They walked Winji out into the hall and headed towards the stairwell.

“Can we fight it?”

“No. It’s—” the Sifu paused her thought, adjusting Winji,—“it will not feel pain. Not the way we do. You cannot fight a thing that you can only wound, but not hurt.”

A grunt from the kitchen below. Some clattering, then it pushed through the kitchen door. In the silver of the moon though the skylights, filtered shimmering through the chandelier, was a naked man. Had a corpse been pulled off the autopsy table and given a necromantic pep-talk, it would have not much differed. Then its rolling eyes locked on hers. It huffed and grinned.

Hye dropped Winji’s arm.

“You have to carry her. Get her to the panic room. I’ll distract it.”

“Hye you cannot—”

“I will not fight it. I cannot carry her alone, you can. You need time. Get her in the room.”

“Hye you will not—”

“I will, I can. Sifu trust me. I can do this.”

The not-man had crashed through the main hall, choosing graceless leaps over couches and chairs rather than take the long way. Hye pulled Trine from her pocket and tucked them into the Sifu’s robe, then ran to the far stairwell. She inhaled sharply through her nose and yelled.

“Here! I’m here. You hideous thing I’m here!”

It made a ravenous turn towards her. There was no version of this plan that went well. Either it ignored her, which was bad, or it didn’t, which was bad. The Sifu already had Winji down the first few stairs on the other side of the corridor. The not-man looked from Hye, back to the Sifu and Winji. Winji’s moans and yelps of pain too loud. It paused, considering.

She took off a shoe and threw it.

“Me! You ugly thing! *Me*!”

That was enough. It bounded towards her, then up the stairs, two at a time, slips and stumbles doing little to slow it. The urge to run was overwhelming, but it the Sifu needed time. She remembered the bisonbear.

Wait.

You get one shot.

Wait for it.

She could see the bared teeth and smell its rot. It left bloody footprints across the carpet. It hunkered and leaped. Hye dropped a shoulder and rolled under and off to the side. She was up and running, but the stairs would be too slow, she realized, it would catch her. In the middle of the corridor, she hopped over the side of the banister, catching herself on the far side. If I dangle, it’s only a twenty foot drop…

The thing smashed through the banister, slamming into her, its hot rotten breath held off by the splintered wood. They were falling together. Hye threw her head back and drove her knees into the thing’s chest, letting the momentum of the impact rotate them midair. It raked bone shard fingertips across her face as they slammed through a table, the creature’s back taking most of the impact. Chunks of wood drove up through it, scraping Hye’s legs, nearly skewering her as well. She rolled backwards off of it. It roared and gurgled, desperately pulling at the wood, showing no signs of slowing, but was, for the moment, pinned.

She looked up to see the safe room door opening, lights blinked on and a few screens booting up within, outlining the Sifu and Winji as they collapsed inside. Hye went to run, her ankle screamed. She hadn’t even noticed she’d hurt it on landing. The roar of the thing behind her drove her past the pain. She limped across the threshold and slammed the “Safe” button. The door hissed closed. On shelves was food, water, medical supplies, changes of clothes, and bed rolls. A small toilet in the corner. Five people for five days, Hye remembered.

Hye collapsed back against the door. The Sifu was moving Winji onto a cot. In the light, Hye could see how pale she was, how dark-stained the sheet-bandage over her shoulder and neck. The throb across her forehead and cheek echoed the stabs of pain in her calf and ankle. She pulled a thumb sized splinter from her calf. Her ankle was already the size of a fist, red and angry. She touched her cheek, red coming with it.

“I need to change her bandage,” said the Sifu. Hye was battered, but she was not dying. The Nubian ambassador was. Opened the medical cabinet and finding the gauze, began prepping. She went to remove the sheet bandage, but the congealed blood had formed a kind of block. The wound beneath was massive. Winji would bleed out before she could get a new bandage on. The irony was all the equipment had little Violet logos all over it. She pulled out a pack of synth blood and hung it from the upper bunk. She wrapped the auto needle patch over Winji’s graying arm.

“We need to get you stable,” said the Sifu. “Then we’ll see about changing that. Just rest Winji, you’re safe now.” Her breaths were slow and shuddering. “Now you.” Advika turned to Hye, lifting a hand to touch her cheek, then looking to her ankle and calf.

“It’s another trap, isn’t it?” Hye asked herself as much as the Sifu. “That’s why the palace grounds were secured for the night, why we were asked to stay within the residences. They meant to trap us in here with whatever that was.”

“Trap me,” said Advika. “You weren’t supposed to be here.”

“That’s nice. You weren’t supposed to be there when they tried to take me and Sun. Now I’m not supposed to be here when they tried to kill you.”

On screen, Hye could almost mistake the thing pulling itself from the wreckage of the table for a man. He was naked and hunched, animalistic. Hye sat at the console, removing the cameras from automatic to get a better look. Blood was everywhere, much of it his own. His nose, lips, and ears were gone, as were his genitals, the wounds oozing. He shuttered and lurched, as if the body did not wish—or know how to—obey, as one might be when nearly paralyzed with rage.

The thing-like-a-man did a circuit through the great hall. Cups and dishes, remnants of the socialites who had remained out after Advika had retired, were scattered here and there. What food there was, the thing consumed. It then moved towards the state rooms. Though spasmodic, its movements were not random, nor chaotic. No, their methodical nature was all the more haunting. Starting at the end of the row, the creature moved along, investigating each room, pushing open the door with agonizing slowness, then staring into the room. It would enter and, often, exit again within moments.

It came to the safe room door. Now hidden behind a false wall, Hye assumed it would wander past, uncaring. But it stopped. Again, with malevolence, it stared. It sniffed the wall, felt along it for some gap. Eventually, it moved on.

Satisfied with its survey of the rooms, the creature began a new ghoulish phase. Starting from the closest staterooms, it began to drag out the bodies. One by one, it pulled them, streaking a gory path to the kitchen. On occasion, it seemed suddenly exhausted. It sat, dropping the arms of the body to smack on the floor. Huge breaths filled its chest. After what seemed a minute, perhaps two, of getting its breath back, the not-a-man pulled a corpse arm close and took a bite. A ragged chunk of arm meat came loose, muscle and sinew dangling over its chin. Hye stifled a cry of horror. Most of one forearm had been consumed, the shape of its twin bones now visible, the remaining hand like a too-thick glove. For half an hour it sat, chest heaving, almost panting. Then, as quick as it had become exhausted, it vivified. Standing, it resumed its grim project.

“Can we kill it?” Hye asked, finally.

The Sifu nodded. “If we had weapons, but our bedclothes and fists aren’t enough. It’s too strong, too dangerous.”

Hye sat with the thought, brow furrowed.

“The duel is in six days,” said Hye. “If Ji-woo is behind this, he, or Violet, wanted you dead, out of the way. But me…”

“Perhaps they would have tried to abduct you again. Or something else. I’ve no doubt the blame would be cast on me—the very threat I released killing me.”

“Or blame me. Say I released it and fled, afraid to fight. Just here to sow destruction. A tidy bow on the problem, regardless.”

“If we were both dead yes, they’d cover somehow.”

“But that’s not what they want. They wanted me, and they knew you were so…”

Hye hesitated.

“Dangerous.” Advika finished the sentence for Hye. “You can say it. I was so dangerous they needed something like an busaw to stop me. They were willing to kill an entire residence to get me out of the way.”

 The biggest, most obvious button was the silent alarm. Press it, and whomever needed to know they were in there would know. She reached for it, then hesitated.

“Which means they’re not just going to let us walk out of here.”

“No. They very much are not.”

As the Sifu spoke, Hye felt her self get dizzy, and collapsed.
