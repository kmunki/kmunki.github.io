The north-bound train sped through the saturnine winter’s day. Koryo’s snowy mountains flattened into high, blighted plains of the edge-lands that ran to the end of the continent. Hye sat, forehead to window, lost in the churning cobalt sea and yellowed-steel sky. Far out over the distant waves, the rain was a charcoal smear, virga under heavy clouds. There was no sun. What ill light there was came from nowhere, diffused through the etherized sky; as though the planet begrudgingly allowed itself be lit. For what else was winter but the whole of the earth tilting away from its source of light and life.

At intervals, a stinging tear would form in the corner of her eye. Though the air within their cabin was calm and still, her eyes burned as if wind-whipped. During the rain-soaked ride out of the mountains she had wept. Numbness since had settled in, her heart wrung out, twisted and squeezed, only the odd drop left. 

Sun. 

Great golden gods of the heavens, where was Sun? 

Sun had always been better able to constrain and command her emotions like servants. They attended her, not she them. Rage, tears, revulsion, terror, and delight were minions, there to achieve a function, to express a need. 

Oh Sun, where have they taken you? 

Hye imagined her sister trapped somewhere, fighting to keep her eyes dry and raised, glass daggers at her captors. The image was a small, heart-lifting gift.

Even the relative calm of the aftermath had not provided real rest—all of it, even the mundane everyday of trying on a suit or buying a train ticket had taken on a patina of dread, like a garden walk where at any moment they might step through covering leaves into a pit of skewers. The train, though, was a picture of serenity. Despite the name, the Peace had not prevented war, death, famine. Moody and covert, nation-on-nation violence now manifested as assassinations, guerrilla strikes, terrorism, civil wars funded and armed via antithetical proxies hoping to have the victor as an ally. To live in this world was to live on edge, save those on the hallowed arteries of the earth, the trains.

As her adrenaline faded, in crept pain and sorrow. Bruises from the explosion, some bone deep,  made no position comfortable. Livid purple and black, yellowed at the edges, they sat like continents on the map of her skin. Sleep once aided by exhaustion was now interrupted by the body’s alarm bells. Each subtle shift of emotion Hye felt, Advika saw. The cues were minute, evanescent, like mumbles of thunder from a storm off beyond the horizon. She is far away, thought the Sifu.

“Hyeon,” said the Sifu, quiet, insistent.

Hye looked up from the window. Curiosity burned in her eyes. Teach me. Let it make sense.

“We are in the Shadow. There is little other way to put it. The laws of the world are now inverted. Those who protected, threaten; those who threaten may be salvation. You guessed some, only some, of my past but this is the world I knew, I lived, some might say I helped create. I had hoped to spare you, for it to end before it arrived, but it is here. So the lessons begin now.”

“I am ready.”

“You are not.” 

There was no malice, no anger in it. Only a profound sadness. She almost whispered it. 

“Grief is strange,” said the Sifu, sounding to herself calmer than she felt, “furtive… confusing… hidden for days then emerging at the oddest of moments. Grief paints with the entire palate, not merely the darker hues.”

“Will I feel this way forever?”

“Life is long,” said the Sifu, “but not forever. Some losses heal. Others leave ragged edges, raw nerves that can still sting. But we will not yet grieve your sister. She is alive. For her sake we must persist. Survive.”

 For a long moment, they were quiet.

“What were those things? That attacked us.”

They had not yet discussed that night. Not in any real way. It remained an unassailable mountain of woe, vast and oppressive. 

“They were ogumo,” said Advika, renaming the terror.

“You said they were soldiers. They looked like monsters.”

“They were both.”

Advika took a long breath. 

“Most of the horrors of war are born of one of two things: attempts to build your army and attempts to destroy your enemy’s spirit. The first few years of the Long War were incomprehensible to the survivors; a week’s death totals might be higher than the entirety of a prior war. Compounded with the initial decimation of plagues and civil conflicts, what was once the terrifying problem of over-population had, within a handful of years become a dream, a wish, a paradise. 

For every nation, the first question of how to survive—to build an army—became the sole concern. Previously enough death would exhaust a nation. Wars of attrition could not linger long enough for replacement to happen. Even with the huge breeder pod facilities and agar-accelerated gestation and maturation, it would be a decade before a new generation could fight. 

Desperation set in fast. We turned to agar. First came raising up animals. Battalions of hybrids were sent into battle, often crazed and suicidal. An entire variant might be created, a new species fresh to this earth, then be armed and leagued with its brethren; a whole un-written history of the future before it, only to be sent to die against a separate species of the same fate. Their entire record of existence coterminous with a single battle. Even those who accepted reincarnation struggled with such grim luck.

In that second lull, where battles continued but in the kind of sad stalemate where volleys were exchanged and the odd unlucky patrol would catch a rogue bullet, an attempt was made to maximize the soldiers one had. Or, more gruesome still, to turn the enemy soldiers against their comrades. 

The ogumo began as one of what must have been hundreds super-soldier projects. Make them taller, stronger, faster. Unrelated experiments, however, yielded an ability to grow any piece of an animal to spec. Need a goat heart with a third pair of chambers and extra enervation? Done. At first, these replacements and transplants allowed soldiers to not just survive, but heal from once fatal damage. One enterprising scientist, however, began building organs that had no analogue. She experimented first with arms and legs, but soon found that she could build a whole body. A body hoping for a host. It would live, for a time, on its own, like a parasite in waiting.

She called it a War Carapace. That’s exactly what it was, an exoskeleton. Why make it alive? To make anyone stronger, it needed its own muscles, and to run those it needed nerves, and to keep all that healthy it needed blood, and so on. 

While testing an early unit, one of their toughest soldiers became trapped behind enemy lines. She survived for weeks, never abandoning the suit. No previous soldier had remained in the suit longer than a few hours, perhaps a day for an intense mission. When recovered, she was different. The suit was not a lumbering set of power armor. She was nimble, reflexive, and able to move in ways far beyond that of other soldiers, even those more experienced with the suit. When they went to remove the suit from her, they found the beginnings of nerve taproots attempting to grow: under her skin, into her spine, through her muscles.

They removed it all the same. 

She described it as being flayed. A kind of survivable vivisection.

And yet; the soldier wanted *more*. If she could augment her muscles, why not her eyes, her brain? A helmet was grown. Additional arms, a second set, were added. The longer she wore the suit, the better it worked, the less she wanted to take it off. But still, agonizingly, she did.

The war, of course, continued, flaring up again as nations thought it would behoove them to be first movers. They were weak, their logic went, so too would be others. Find a last reserve of strength, strike now and end it! Of course, we are never as tough, they are never as weak as we believe—because we are never that different. Jee learned this lesson a few times, then felt she needed to re-learn it under each new Viceroy.

I digress. With the war worsening, our soldier was sent into the field on a long mission. She lived in the suit—sleeping, hunting, and fighting, always fighting, a wraith on the battlefield. When she returned she and the suit had bonded. Removal would be fatal. The first ogumo was born.

The suit was more than symbiotic— it was consumptive as well. Once bonded fully, the human inside was slowly overridden by the suit. In time, it drove the wearer insane and, eventually, killed them both. Ogumo are the apotheosis of a soldier, the end goal. A being that exists only to fight. There is no one left at the end. No sad maimed veteran to care for, no over-proud general, just a cadaver with a great kill ratio.”

Advika stopped, her eyes on the floor of the train. Hye’s were riveted to her teacher.

Of the many worries ogumo presented, mere existence was what most haunted Advika. 

“They were supposed to be gone. Ogumo are not tools, not a gun you put in storage. They’re not swarms that infinitely breed. Ogumo shells are grown. Special equipment, tacit knowledge are required. Almost no written or recorded instruction captures the nuance of hand-to-hand training. Knowledge must be passed on, not merely preserved. There is a reason the library is part of a school, not the school itself. Information requires interpretation, context, demonstration. Like so much war-tech the end of the ogumo came not when all the ogumo were dead, but the people who built them were too, along with their equipment. They were assumed gone. All of them.”

“But that means… they found… no they had to grow, but… how?”

“I don’t know. Whomever took your sister, whomever is after you, Hye, is resurrecting war-relics.”

Night fell. The train plunged along through the meters-deep path in carved through Siberian snow. The low glow of the guide lights rippled across the uneven wall of surrounding white. 

Hye’s stomach had grown tired of being empty. It rumbled and gurgled as they walked to the dining car. The gentle rock and sway of the train brought Hye’s hand up, in part for the balance, in part to it run it along the low ceiling. More than stabilizing, she could feel the train through its skin: engine hum, buffeting winds, subtle metal flex as they rounded a curve. Beyond were whatever frozen horrors the Taiga Wilds offered. Not a hand’s width separated civilization and chaos. Yet she did not withdraw from it, but pressed her palm to it, wishing to feel it through the barrier.

The dining car itself was that odd mix of austerity and elegance one finds in such places. Small, simple booths, easy to clean, all of it affixed to the floor. A spot of respite for the a weary soldier or business traveler, their suits rumpled at the shoulders from being slept in, smooth with wear at the elbows and knees.

Busier than expected at the late hour, few tables were open. By luck a pair of seats cleared at a small table. In addition to the surrounding traders and odd lone soldiers on leave, there were the almost-wealthy luxuriating in public; immigrants with their whole lives in a bag; the occasional indiscernible brooding bunch. Behind Advika sat one such table. Grizzled and dark, three brutes of ambiguous profession and purpose were hunched over their drink and expensively-shaped food which they ate with a somber relish.

“I’ll order for us,” said Advika, “train food is… mmm, some things just don’t travel well.”

Hye nodded. A calm had washed over her. She let her gaze drift through the car, lulled by the ambient sounds of clinking utensils on plates and the murmuration of the conversational chorus. 

“By the blade, that job,” growled one of the brutes, her catching Hye’s attention. With casual cool, she let her eyes drift away, while her ears took focus.

“In and out, smash and grab. Look at us,” said a bitter second, holding an arm close to her side. “Three left of *ten*. Even one of the og—“

“*Hsss* don’t say it, not even here,” said an icy third, using her knife to pull bits of steak from her teeth.

Not lifting her heavy brows from her drink, the growler said, “what good they did us.”

“We got one, didn’t we?”

“One, hah,” the bitter one coughed a laugh, “of two. Two *princesses*,” she said through clenched teeth. “Ten mercs plus two. Two over-promised beetles. Myrmidons my ass.”

“Were we set up?”

“A fair question,” said the icy one. “None of this was ordinary. Two monsters and two hands-worth of us for what? Some old woman and pampered girls—who fought like demons.”

“And that Viceroy. Blowing herself up.”

Hye dug her nails into her thigh.

A round of nods and then a collective sigh.

“Boss said the client would pay the same rate again for the second one, that’s still out there.”

“Sadiya is offering the same *again?* We won’t have to work for a year.”

“You saw what happened. That old woman is no joke.”

As they spoke, the old Sifu returned with two mugs of tea, steam writhing out of them. Her face was kind, sympathetic. Then it shifted. Hye watched as her own fear transformed the Sifu’s face.

“That last business deal sure was a tough one, eh?” Said Hye, bugging her eyes at her Sifu, making the hand-signal for danger, begging for understanding. “Nice to know it’s *behind us*.”

Advika nodded slowly, letting out a sigh of empathy, then leaned back in her chair, throwing one arm over the back, “Aye, it was. But rookie you’ll learn that they’re all tough in their own way.” She took a long slurp of tea, savoring it loudly. “Come here let me tell you some secrets of the trade.”

In a conspiratorial pose, the two hunched over their tea.

“Mercenaries,” Hye whispered. “They mentioned the viceroy and… monsters.”

“Said I *won’t do it*,” growled a mercenary.

She pushed back her glass and stood. Her gaze flicked to Hye. A chance glance, nothing more or less. Hesitation, an instant of it, was enough.

The merc looked at Hye, then at the back of the Sifu’s head, then back to Hye. Not this easy. Not *right here*. She walked around Advika to the table and slapped her hands down. *Well what do we have here* plastered all over her face. The other two mercs stood, confused, then it dawned.

“Them?”

Advika didn’t look away. She stared right back, purple eyes ablaze as the icy one nodded.

The bitter one laughed.

“Oh, no. Not your lucky day, now is it?”

“We are on a train. This is all-land,” said Hye, protesting.

“It is at that!” Said the bitter one, “but Istanbul is not. Not Cairo or Timbuktu, Lagos, eGoli. Only the trains, only the stations. Your ticket runs out at some point. Where ever you go, we’ll be waiting outside.”

“Don’t fight it,” growled the other, “just come with us at Istanbul. You’re not getting off before then!”

“If you’re thinking of jumping out, just knock on my door,” said the bitter one, “suicide needn’t be painful, I’ll put a bullet in you. You’re worth more alive, but I’m a generous gal, eh?” She ribbed her comrade and laughed.

“I think,” said the icy one standing, “I shall have myself another drink to celebrate.” She walked past her colleagues towards the bar. Laughing, the other two followed. She turned, “enjoy your dinner!”

Advika and Hye ate, quickly, quietly, and left, ignoring the taunts of the mercenaries.

Back in their stateroom, Hye fought hysteria.

“Which, ummm… ah, which station would—“ she struggled to complete thoughts. She didn’t know the stations. Not well enough to think of escape routes, of optional exists, of places to hide. If forced she couldn’t have come up with a strategy for Pyongyang, forget Cairo.

The Sifu, calmly taking down her bag, began removing a few items and said, “we have to get off this train *tonight*.”
