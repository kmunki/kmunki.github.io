    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kyle. I'm a writer and product manager interested in bioethics, AI, and literature. I've been a product manager for almost a decade, where I did the most applied philosophy thing I could do by building technology that helped make healthcare better. I'm on sabbatical at the moment and am actively looking for the <em>next</em> revolution in healthcare I can help make happen.</p>

    <h2>What I'm Doing On Sabbatical</h2>

    <p>I'm working on a second novel and regularly write essays about normal stuff like transhumanism, artificial wombs, and replacing death. You can read them here or on <a href="https://daysof.substack.com">Days of Miracle and Wonder.</a>, my blog on Substack.</p>

    <p>I've also spent a good deal of time learning to work better with AI. Since the summer, I've been working with Claude Code to build a variety of co-writing tools, which, after a while, I realized were all a lot worse than Claude Code itself, so I've been working on helping Claude read a novel-in-progress more easily. All that context is gnarly, but fun! I also built myself a couple apps that let me collaborate with Claude on the go, mostly for managing my news feeds and todos.</p>

    <p>I also built this website! With Claude, obviously.</p>

    <p>At <strong>Amazon Health Services</strong> (Oct 2023 - June 2025) — Led the launch of One Medical's first <a href='https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-one-medical-launches-ai-tools-for-better-patient-care'>provider-facing AI products</a>. These are now used tens of thousands times per week by hundreds of clinicians in daily patient care.</p>

    <p>At <strong>One Medical</strong> (May 2012 - Oct 2023) I spent the first third of my career in operations and service design, making internal processes and systems better, and the rest in product, working on every single part of the tech stack and buisiness, internal and customer facing.</p>
